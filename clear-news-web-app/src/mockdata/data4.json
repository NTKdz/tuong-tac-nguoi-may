        "body": "WASHINGTON: Former US vice president Mike Pence said that he would not be backing Donald Trump as his old boss runs for a second term in the White House.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUS media called the announcement a \"bombshell\" and \"startling,\" although in reality deep divisions have driven the two men apart since leaving office, and an endorsement would have been a surprise.\n\nThe pair became estranged after Trump tried to pressure Pence to help him overturn his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden, repeatedly attacking him on social media when he wouldn't go along with the scheme.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT Sabah revenue hits RM6.97 billion: Hajiji says GRS State Government may see full term Kota Kinabalu: The Sabah Government continued its momentum in managing the economy in line with the commitment and spirit of the Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ) when it posted record high state revenue of RM6.973 billion last year. Read more After various attempts by Trump and his allies to subvert the election results failed, the then-president directed a mob of his supporters to march on the Capitol, where they ransacked the building as some chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\"\n\nPence told Fox News that Trump was \"pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe 64-year-old's comments come days after Trump secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in November.\n\nPence was one of Trump's early rivals in the primary contest ahead of the 2024 election, although he quit the race last October after failing to poll in double figures.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPence did not offer an alternative endorsement -- there are several third-party candidates running -- and said he would never vote for Biden, who secured the Democratic nomination this week.\n\nPence gave Trump years of unswervingly loyal service before the insurrection in Washington.\n\nBut he called the president's actions on January 6, 2021, \"reckless\" and said they \"endangered me and my family.\"\n\nTrump had demanded Pence, a former governor of Indiana, to derail the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory.\n\nPence refused, gaining the enmity of Trump's diehard followers and becoming persona non grata within the hard right \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\n\nThe evangelical Christian also received unwelcome headlines after leaving office over an FBI search of his home -- part of a wider Washington scandal over mishandled classified documents -- and a subpoena to testify before a federal probe into the Capitol riot, which he resisted.\n\nHe defended the record of the 2017-21 Trump administration in his Fox News interview, saying he was \"incredibly proud\" of its achievements.\n\n\"It was a conservative record that made America more prosperous, more secure, and saw conservatives appointed to our courts in a more peaceful world,\" he said.\n\n\"But that being said, during my presidential campaign I made clear there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues.\"\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The drought is over after 37 long years. The \"Cardiac Pack\" are alive and well, and they'll keep dancing into the NCAA Tournament. DJ Horne scored 29 points as North Carolina State, seeded 10th, pulled off its improbable fifth victory in five days on Saturday night, beating top-seeded North Carolina 84-76 to win the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament for the first time since 1987. \"I'm emotional. I'm proud. I'm excited. Our players deserve this,\" Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts said Saturday. \"These guys and the other guys in the locker room, they do all the heavy lifting. I just try to orchestrate stuff, put them in the right spots, but they have done a great job. This says a lot. We've been getting crushed -- when I say we, NC State -- by not delivering any championship in 37 years. Well, they can't say that now because we got one tonight.\" For North Carolina (27-7) -- ranked No. 4 in the AP poll -- the loss snapped an eight-game winning streak. The play of DJ Burns Jr., who had 20 points and a career-high-tying seven assists, also helped power the Wolfpack (22-14). North Carolina State is the lowest-seeded team to ever win the conference tournament. In addition to the performances of Horne and Burns, Mohamed Diarra had a game-high 14 rebounds and 11 points, while Michael O'Connell chipped in 10 points. North Carolina was aiming for its first ACC postseason title since 2016 and was looking to potentially seal up a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. What hurt the Tar Heels was their defense, as they allowed North Carolina State to shoot 54.9 percent from the floor, the third-highest mark North Carolina has allowed to an opponent all season. \"We just couldn't guard them tonight,\" Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis said following the game. \"We weren't able to guard them one-on-one, whether it was on the post, isolations out on the wing. Didn't play the type of defense that you have to have in order to win games like this.\" While RJ Davis -- the ACC Player of the Year -- and Armando Bacot stuffed the stat sheet for North Carolina, only one other Tar Heel scored in double figures. Davis finished with 30 points on 10-of-26 shooting while Bacot had 18 points and 12 rebounds. Harrison Ingram added 10 points. Much of the game centered around an old-school battle in the post between Burns and Bacot, but North Carolina State knocked down a trio of 3-pointers in the opening five minutes of the game to jump out to a 14-4 lead. North Carolina battled back behind the play of Davis, whose 3-pointer at the 6:46 mark of the first half tied the game at 28-28. Cormac Ryan's 3-pointer with two seconds to go in the first half gave the Tar Heels a one-point advantage, 40-39, at the break. The Wolfpack played through Burns for much of the first half, giving him plenty of touches in the paint. The imposing forward either bulldozed his way to the basket or passed out to an open shooter when double-teamed. He finished the first half with 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting to go with six assists. \"I just allowed him to catch the ball where he really wanted to,\" Bacot said of defending Burns. \"When he gets it at that point, it's really tough to guard him.\" North Carolina State snatched the lead back in the second half. With 7:04 to play, Horne was fouled as he sank a layup, and he let out a scream, flexed and high-fived Wolfpack fans sitting courtside before swishing a free throw to push his team's advantage to eight points. Horne -- who fouled out with 1:17 to play -- scored 16 points in the second half and went 9-for-11 from the free-throw line after intermission. \"We came into this tournament knowing that our season was on the line, so there was no room for mistakes,\" Horne said. \"I think everybody really took heed to that and took it personally.\" With less than a minute to play, two free throws from Diarra pushed North Carolina State's lead to 12 points, its largest advantage of the game. This was the seventh time that North Carolina and North Carolina State met in the ACC tournament championship, where the Tar Heels are now 4-3 against the Wolfpack. The tournament will change next year when Stanford, Cal and SMU join the league, and the teams that finish in the bottom three of the regular-season standings will be excluded from the field. For now, the Wolfpack and Tar Heels will focus on rest ahead of Selection Sunday. Burns, in his final statement of the postgame press conference said, \"I will say, my legs hurt right now.\" --Mitchell Northam, Field Level Media",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tyon Grant-Foster scored 22 points, Ray Harrison added 15 of his 19 in the second half and top-seeded Grand Canyon beat UT Arlington 89-74 Saturday night to win the Western Athletic Conference Tournament for the second consecutive season and clinch an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Lopes have appeared five of the last six WAC Tournament title games, winning three of the last four.\n\nLok Wur scored 16 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. 14 for Grand Canyon (29-4).\n\nPhillip Russell led UT Arlington (20-14) with 22 points, including four 3-pointers. Shemar Wilson added 13 points and Akili Vining 10.\n\nHarrison converted a three-point play and followed with two free throws to open the second half as Grand Canyon scored 14 of the first 21 points to open its biggest lead at 50-39 with 15 minutes to play. Brandyn Talbot answered with two free throws before Phillip Russell hit a 3 to trim the deficit to six points a minute later and made another from beyond the arc to make it 68-64 with 4 minutes remaining.\n\nMcGlothan answered with a monstrous two-hand dunk before Talbot hit another 3 to cut UTA's deficit to three points but Harrison hit two free throws and the Mavericks committed turnovers on their next two possessions and, each time, Grant-Foster hit two free throws before Harrison made a layup to cap an 8-0 run and make it 78-67 with 1:43 to go.\n\nMoore threw down a fast-break dunk with 2.9 seconds left that stretched Grand Canyon's lead to 86-74 -- the Lopes' biggest of the game. Russell, who apparently took umbrage with the play, seemed to intentionally bump Moore, who was then hit with the ball following a baseball pass by Vining. Moore was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul, Vining a technical foul and both players were ejected.\n\nDerrick Michael Xzavierro, who didn't play for Grand Canyon, was also ejected for leaving the bench area.\n\nUT Arlington shot 49% (25 of 51) from the field and limited the Lopes to just 40% (23 of 58) shooting but the Mavericks were outscored 37-14 from the free-throw line, where GCU attempted a Division-I program record 50 shots.\n\nGrand Canyon scored 32 points off 26 Mavericks turnovers and committed 14, which UTA converted into just 11 points.\n\nNo. 3 seed UT Arlington made its only NCAA Tournament appearance when the Mavericks won the 2008 Southland Conference Tournament. UTA joined the WAC prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\n___\n\nGet alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here\n\n___",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tyon Grant-Foster scored 22 points, Ray Harrison added 15 of his 19 in the second half and top-seeded Grand Canyon beat UT Arlington 89-74 Saturday night to win the Western Athletic Conference Tournament for the second consecutive season and clinch an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Lopes have appeared five of the last six WAC Tournament title games, winning three of the last four.\n\nLok Wur scored 16 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. 14 for Grand Canyon (29-4).\n\nPhillip Russell led UT Arlington (20-14) with 22 points, including four 3-pointers. Shemar Wilson added 13 points and Akili Vining 10.\n\nHarrison converted a three-point play and followed with two free throws to open the second half as Grand Canyon scored 14 of the first 21 points to open its biggest lead at 50-39 with 15 minutes to play. Brandyn Talbot answered with two free throws before Phillip Russell hit a 3 to trim the deficit to six points a minute later and made another from beyond the arc to make it 68-64 with 4 minutes remaining.\n\nMcGlothan answered with a monstrous two-hand dunk before Talbot hit another 3 to cut UTA's deficit to three points but Harrison hit two free throws and the Mavericks committed turnovers on their next two possessions and, each time, Grant-Foster hit two free throws before Harrison made a layup to cap an 8-0 run and make it 78-67 with 1:43 to go.\n\nMoore threw down a fast-break dunk with 2.9 seconds left that stretched Grand Canyon's lead to 86-74 -- the Lopes' biggest of the game. Russell, who apparently took umbrage with the play, seemed to intentionally bump Moore, who was then hit with the ball following a baseball pass by Vining. Moore was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul, Vining a technical foul and both players were ejected.\n\nDerrick Michael Xzavierro, who didn't play for Grand Canyon, was also ejected for leaving the bench area.\n\nUT Arlington shot 49% (25 of 51) from the field and limited the Lopes to just 40% (23 of 58) shooting but the Mavericks were outscored 37-14 from the free-throw line, where GCU attempted a Division-I program record 50 shots.\n\nGrand Canyon scored 32 points off 26 Mavericks turnovers and committed 14, which UTA converted into just 11 points.\n\nNo. 3 seed UT Arlington made its only NCAA Tournament appearance when the Mavericks won the 2008 Southland Conference Tournament. UTA joined the WAC prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\n___\n\nGet alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

Shemar Wilson added 13 points and Akili Vining 10.\n\nHarrison converted a three-point play and followed with two free throws to open the second half as Grand Canyon scored 14 of the first 21 points to open its biggest lead at 50-39 with 15 minutes to play. Brandyn Talbot answered with two free throws before Phillip Russell hit a 3 to trim the deficit to six points a minute later and made another from beyond the arc to make it 68-64 with 4 minutes remaining.\n\nMcGlothan answered with a monstrous two-hand dunk before Talbot hit another 3 to cut UTA's deficit to three points but Harrison hit two free throws and the Mavericks committed turnovers on their next two possessions and, each time, Grant-Foster hit two free throws before Harrison made a layup to cap an 8-0 run and make it 78-67 with 1:43 to go.\n\nMoore threw down a fast-break dunk with 2.9 seconds left that stretched Grand Canyon's lead to 86-74 -- the Lopes' biggest of the game. Russell, who apparently took umbrage with the play, seemed to intentionally bump Moore, who was then hit with the ball following a baseball pass by Vining. Moore was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul, Vining a technical foul and both players were ejected.\n\nDerrick Michael Xzavierro, who didn't play for Grand Canyon, was also ejected for leaving the bench area.\n\nUT Arlington shot 49% (25 of 51) from the field and limited the Lopes to just 40% (23 of 58) shooting but the Mavericks were outscored 37-14 from the free-throw line, where GCU attempted a Division-I program record 50 shots.\n\nGrand Canyon scored 32 points off 26 Mavericks turnovers and committed 14, which UTA converted into just 11 points.\n\nNo. 3 seed UT Arlington made its only NCAA Tournament appearance when the Mavericks won the 2008 Southland Conference Tournament. UTA joined the WAC prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\nGet alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here",

Russell, who apparently took umbrage with the play, seemed to intentionally bump Moore, who was then hit with the ball following a baseball pass by Vining. Moore was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul, Vining a technical foul and both players were ejected.\n\nDerrick Michael Xzavierro, who didn't play for Grand Canyon, was also ejected for leaving the bench area.\n\nUT Arlington shot 49% (25 of 51) from the field and limited the Lopes to just 40% (23 of 58) shooting but the Mavericks were outscored 37-14 from the free-throw line, where GCU attempted a Division-I program record 50 shots.\n\nGrand Canyon scored 32 points off 26 Mavericks turnovers and committed 14, which UTA converted into just 11 points.\n\nNo. 3 seed UT Arlington made its only NCAA Tournament appearance when the Mavericks won the 2008 Southland Conference Tournament. UTA joined the WAC prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\n___\n\nGet alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

        "body": "SEASIDE -- Granted, it's a small sample size. Yet, it is more than optimism running through the veins of players for Monterey Bay F.C.\n\nThe Union own a share of first place in the United Soccer League's Western Conference after Saturday's home opening 1-0 win over defending league champion Phoenix Rising.\n\nAt 1-0-1, the Union are one of five teams that have four points through the second week of the season in their third year in the USL.\n\nHaving missed the postseason in each of its first two seasons, Monterey Bay F.C. has seen positive results in retooling its roster this spring, relying on a tenacious defense that secured its first shutout Saturday.\n\nHaving rallied late in its season opener on Wednesday to salvage a tie at El Paso, Texas, the Union had 4,867 fans on their feet 22 minutes into the match when Rafa Baca produced the game's only goal on an assist from CSUMB alum Adrian Rebollar.\n\nFrom that point, the Union turned to their defense, where goalie Antony Siaha continued his masterly between the pipes with a handful of stops for his first shutout of the young season.\n\nSiaha, who recorded five clean sheets and 58 saves last season for the Union, is fifth in the Western Conference in saves with seven.\n\nPhoenix, who earned a postseason spot last year by finishing fifth in the Western Conference enroute to capturing its first USL title, fell to 0-2-0 on the season.\n\nCarmel High graduate Pierce Gallaway, who spent time with MBFC2 last summer, made his professional debut as a second half substitute.\n\nMonterey Bay F.C. will have seven days to prepare for USL newcomer Rhode Island (0-0-1), who it will host for the first time on Sunday at 3 p.m.",

        "body": "Vandalia, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Mar, 2024) Donald Trump told a rally in Ohio on Saturday that November's presidential election will be the \"most important date\" in US history, painting his campaign for the White House as a turning point for the country.\n\nDays after securing his position as the presumptive Republican nominee, the former president also warned of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not elected -- though it was not clear what he was referring to, with the remark coming in the middle of comments about threats to the US auto industry.\n\n\"The date -- remember this, November 5 -- I believe it's going to be the most important date in the history of our country,\" the 77-year-old told rally-goers in Vandalia, Ohio, repeating well-worn criticisms that his rival, President Joe Biden, is the \"worst\" president.\n\nCriticizing what he said were Chinese plans to build cars in Mexico and sell them to Americans, he stated: \"We're going to put a 100 percent tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected.\"\n\n\"Now if I don't get elected it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole -- that's going to be the least of it, it's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. But they're not going to sell those cars.\"\n\nThe 81-year-old, who has waved off concerns that he is too old for a second term, leavened his rhetoric with humor.\n\nAmong the issues Trump is campaigning on is sweeping reform of what he calls Biden's \"horror show\" immigration policies, despite the ex-president successfully pressuring Republicans to block a bill in Congress that included the toughest border security measures in decades.\n\nOn Saturday he invoked the border again as he reached out to minorities who have traditionally voted Democrat.\n\nHe said Biden had \"repeatedly stabbed African-American voters in the back\" by granting work permits to \"millions\" of immigrants, warning that they and Hispanic Americans \"are going to be the ones that suffer the most.\"",

          "body": "Vandalia, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Mar, 2024) Donald Trump told a rally in Ohio on Saturday that November's presidential election will be the \"most important date\" in US history, painting his campaign for the White House as a turning point for the country.\n\nDays after securing his position as the presumptive Republican nominee, the former president also warned of a \"bloodbath\" if he is not elected -- though it was not clear what he was referring to, with the remark coming in the middle of comments about threats to the US auto industry.\n\n\"The date -- remember this, November 5 -- I believe it's going to be the most important date in the history of our country,\" the 77-year-old told rally-goers in Vandalia, Ohio, repeating well-worn criticisms that his rival, President Joe Biden, is the \"worst\" president.\n\nCriticizing what he said were Chinese plans to build cars in Mexico and sell them to Americans, he stated: \"They're not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected.\n\n\"Now if I don't get elected it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole, that's going to be the least of it, it's going to be a bloodbath for the country. That'll be the least of it. But they're not going to sell those cars.\"\n\nAmong the issues Trump is campaigning on is sweeping reform of what he calls Biden's \"horror show\" immigration policies, despite successfully pressuring Republicans to block a bill in Congress that included the toughest border security measures in decades.\n\nOn Saturday he invoked the border again as he reached out to minorities who have traditionally voted Democrat.\n\nHe said Biden had \"repeatedly stabbed African-American voters in the back\" by granting work permits to \"millions\" of immigrants, warning that they and Hispanic Americans \"are going to be the ones that suffer the most.\"",

        "title": "Warriors meet the moment to beat Lakers in possible play-in preview",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- From the courtside celebrities to the star power in the nationally televised game and tense finish, much of Saturday night's game felt like a playoff game.\n\nThe Warriors and Lakers, projected to play each other in the 9-10 play-in round exactly a month from Saturday's meeting, lived up to the big-game billing.\n\nEach team appeared to bring their top-level intensity, Warriors coach Steve Kerr trimmed his rotation to a playoff-style nine. The game took on a different tone when Lakers star Anthony Davis suffered a corneal abrasion and didn't return after the first quarter. And then it turned bizarre at the end, when the shot clock became suddenly fried.\n\n\"Definitely weird,\" Steph Curry said of the ending. \"I watch a lot of golf, I want to know if they did like that 'playing through' thing where you see the commercials running and you're just waiting for the game to come back. Probably not the greatest for TV.\"\n\nStill, in front of Kim Kardashian, Bad Bunny and Novak Djokovic, Curry, Klay Thompson and Jonathan Kuminga combined for 80 points to vault the Warriors over the Lakers in the standings. The defense might not have been up to postseason par, especially with Davis off the court, but the Warriors (35-31) absorbed a playoff-caliber LeBron James performance (40 points, nine assists, eight rebounds) in the 128-121 win.\n\n\"Definitely a playoff-type atmosphere,\" Draymond Green (TK stats) said postgame. \"We knew how much this game means, they knew how much it means.\"\n\nThe Warriors had this game circled for at least a week: their I-5 rivals in enemy territory, with a chance to surpass them in the standings and take a step toward a coveted tie-breaker. Not to mention an individual matchup of LeBron James and Steph Curry, the two defining stars of their generation.\n\nKerr reminded the team just how consequential this game is at practice at UCLA on Friday, giving a speech that Green said helped them lock in.\n\n\"I believe in this team, I believe it can make a really good run, and this is obviously a big game if we're going to make that run,\" Kerr said pregame.\n\nCurry didn't rush his recovery from the ankle sprain that knocked him out the previous three games, but made note of the point in the season the Warriors find themselves in when discussing his imminent return with reporters. He wasn't going to miss this game.\n\nOn the Crypto.com Arena court pregame, Curry went through a full-speed round of warmups. It took him a few tries, but he nailed a halfcourt shot to end the routine, skipping over to assistant coach Anthony Vereen to celebrate. He took a photo with former MLB superstar Albert Pujols and trotted back to the locker room. Curry, and the entire joyous, spectacular package that comes with him, was back.\n\nBut it was Curry's backcourt partner, Thompson, who carried the Warriors as Curry went scoreless in the first quarter. Thompson dropped 18 in his first eight minutes. He hunted shots from the 3-point arc and midrange and worked the two-man game with Trayce Jackson-Davis for an and-1.\n\nCurry's first bucket came five minutes into the second quarter. By then, James had registered 16 points and six assists on 6-for-6 shooting. At least on the offensive end, he treated the game like it carried some extra weight.\n\nGolden State surged with Davis in the locker room for the entire second quarter due to an apparent eye injury. When Davis was on the court, especially as Draymond Green rested, the Warriors looked way too small to contend with Los Angeles' front line.\n\nWith Davis unavailable, Curry got going with drives and Green found Jonathan Kuminga on consecutive alley-oop lobs -- one from halfcourt and another on the short roll -- to earn a halftime lead.\n\nDavis' absence allowed Golden State to play inside-out. To create a Curry four-point play, every Warrior touched the ball. Then he and Kuminga drove for consecutive layups.\n\nWithout Davis protecting the rim, Golden State scored 35 points in the third. James prevented them from sustaining a double-digit lead, sensing the Lakers needed him to take over.\n\nThe Warriors matched James' fourth quarter minutes with Kuminga and Curry's, hoping to mitigate the 20-time All-Star. But consecutive and-1s from James through Kuminga trimmed Golden State's 10-point lead to six.\n\nGreen guarded James slightly more down the stretch, but James still played bully ball, constantly attacking the rim and either finishing or earning free throws. He drilled a step-back 3 in the corner over Curry, which for a moment inched the Lakers within four but later got negated because he was out of bounds. The replay review might've been the biggest swing of the game.\n\nIn a strange twist, shot clock issues and extensive replay reviews that made the final two minutes last over 20. The Lakers' PA announcer manually informing the arena of the dwindling shot clock. By then, a playoff-level game devolved into a bizarre, embarrassing footnote. One that the Warriors finished off.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden joked about Donald Trump and his own age at an annual media dinner on Saturday (Mar 16) before unloading deadly serious criticisms of his rival in November's election.\n\n\"One candidate's too old and mentally unfit to be president,\" the 81-year-old Democrat quipped at the Gridiron Club in Washington. \"The other guy's me.\"\n\nDemocrat Biden was making his first speech as president at the annual white-tie gala for the US media and political elite, an event that Republican former president Trump addressed in 2018.\n\nBiden is trailing in a number of polls and faces voters' concerns about his age, which he has tried to address by highlighting 77-year-old Trump's recent verbal slip-ups.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden took a swipe at Republicans in Congress who have launched an impeachment inquiry into his son's business dealings, saying they would \"rather fail at impeachment than succeed at anything else\".\n\nHe added that Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, sitting at the head table with Biden on the eve of St Patrick's Day \"took one look at Congress and he asked for another Guinness\".\n\nVaradkar and Biden both pushed during a meeting at the White House on Friday for Republicans in Congress to stop blocking military aid for Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nBut Biden then returned to Trump, saying that the Democrats' election campaign would show how they rebuilt the US economy after the COVID-19 pandemic \"without encouraging the American people to inject bleach\".\n\nHe was referring to an incident when Trump, as president, asked a top medical advisor whether virus victims could be injected with disinfectant to cure them.\n\n\"Look, I wish these were jokes, but they're not,\" added Biden.\n\n\"Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin's on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says, 'Do whatever the hell you want'.\"",

        "title": "Curry Scores 31 in Return as Warriors Defeat Lakers 128-121 Despite 40 Points From James",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Stephen Curry belatedly celebrated his birthday by returning to the Golden State lineup and leading the Warriors to a much-needed victory.\n\nCurry, who turned 36 on Thursday, scored 31 points after missing the last three games with a sprained right ankle as the Warriors beat the Los Angeles Lakers 128-121 on Saturday night, March 16, in a pivotal Western Conference matchup.\n\n\"Steph is Steph. He's just amazing,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"He got off to a slow start, but he never worries and we never worry. What he does is open the floor for everyone else.\"\n\nThe Warriors inched ahead of the Lakers by a percentage point into ninth place in the West after winning a game that dragged to the finish because of a pair of replay reviews -- one that overturned an apparent 3-pointer by LeBron James -- then a malfunctioning clock.\n\nJames had 40 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. D'Angelo Russell added 23 points and 13 assists for the Lakers, who have dropped their last two.\n\nIf the season ended Saturday, the Warriors would be hosting the Lakers in the play-in tournament, with the loser eliminated. Both teams are 3 1/2 games behind Phoenix for sixth place and escaping the play-in games, but time is running out.\n\n\"I was excited just to be back. You understand the ramifications down the stretch. Every game, especially against teams jumbled right there in the play-in, matters,\" said Curry, who was 12 of 24 from the field along with six rebounds and five assists in 31 minutes.\n\nKlay Thompson added 26 off the bench and Jonathan Kuminga 23 as the Warriors dominated play inside and regularly drove to the rim after Lakers All-Star center Anthony Davis did not play the final three periods after he was poked in the eye late in the first quarter.\n\nGolden State took advantage of Davis' injury as it dominated inside. The Warriors outrebounded the Lakers by six and had a 62-54 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nDraymond Green was held to six points, but had 13 assists and 12 rebounds after he missed the last game due to back soreness.\n\nCurry had six points during a 10-2 third-quarter run that gave the Warriors a 91-79 lead. Neither team had more than a seven-point lead until that point.\n\n\"They made some adjustments at halftime. In the third quarter we came out and missed some really good shots after getting some good looks. They played better than we did in the third,\" James said.\n\nThompson had 21 points in the first half as the Warriors held a 67-66 lead at halftime. It was the second time this season Thompson has scored at least 20 in the first half.\n\nJames, who was 6 of 16 from the field in Wednesday night's loss at Sacramento, was 15 of 23 against the Warriors. He hit his first six shots, including three 3-pointers.\n\nA 3-pointer by Thompson with 7:41 remaining in the fourth quarter gave the Warriors a 113-101 advantage, before the Lakers started to slowly work their way back.\n\nJames appeared to hit a 3-pointer with 2:07 remaining to get the Lakers within four, but during a stoppage in play 17 seconds later, the replay center determined James' foot was out of bounds and took the basket away.\n\nThe reversal ended any momentum for the Lakers. The Warriors put away the game when Curry stole the ball from James and passed it to Kuminga for a breakaway dunk to make it 126-117.\n\n\"We dig back into it, and make a big shot. Guys are scrambling, competing and then boom, everything just stops. So it just took the rhythm out of the game,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said.",

        "body": "Los Angeles: The Los Angeles home of model and actor Cara Delevingne was destroyed in a fire Friday.\n\nOne firefighter was taken to a hospital in fair condition with unspecified injuries, and one unidentified person from the house suffered minor smoke inhalation, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Nicholas Prange said.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\nDelevingne shared several Instagram stories referring to the fire after TMZ reported that the house in the Studio City neighborhood that was engulfed in flames before dawn belonged to her. Delevingne is currently appearing in a production of \"Cabaret\" on London's West End and was apparently not at home.\n\nFirefighters arrived at the two-story house to find heavy fire in the rear, which destroyed a room and spread to the attic, Prange said. Once fire crews made certain everyone was out of the house, they took a defensive position and the roof collapsed. It took them more than two hours to put out the flames.\n\nHours later, Delevingne, shared a video that showed a street full of fire trucks with lights flashing.\n\n\"Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the firefighters and people that have showed up to help,\" another Instagram story read.\n\nA third Instagram story showed a photo of two cats with the caption, \" My heart is broken today I cannot believe it life can change in the blink of an eye cherish what you have.\" She later clarified with another post that her cats were not hurt in the fire.\n\nThe home also matches one that was featured in a 2021 profile in Architectural Digest . The white brick house with two pools and two trampolines in the backyard was built in 1941 for the Von der Ahe family, founders of the Vons grocery chain.\n\nDelevingne and her designer added playful elements, including a costume room for dress-up parties, a bathroom that's a memorial to David Bowie, poker and billiard rooms, and a ball pit.\n\n\"If I'm having a bad day, I just hop in the ball pit,\" Delevingne told the magazine. \"You can't really cry in a ball pit.\"\n\nDelevingne's representatives did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe cause was under investigation.\n\nThe 31-year-old London-born Delevingne became widely known as a fashion model in the early 2010s and later began acting, appearing in the 2016 DC Comics film \"Suicide Squad\" and director Luc Besson's 2017 \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets.\"\n\nShe also appeared in the Hulu series \"Only Murders in the Building\" with Steve Martin , Martin Short and Selena Gomez in 2022, and on FX's \"American Horror Story\" in 2023.",

        "body": "Mar. 16 -- \"Spokane Velocity\" chants, smoke shooting into the air after home goals and fans donned in black and light blue shirts and scarves.\n\nThat was the scene of the Velocity's first home game as more than 5,000 fans watched its new professional soccer team beat the Richmond Kickers 2-1 on a sun-splashed Saturday afternoon at ONE Spokane Stadium.\n\nIt didn't take long for an already excited fan base to cheer as the Velocity, the newest member of the United Soccer League's League One, put two goals into the net in the first 15 minutes.\n\nThe sellout crowd roared louder on the second goal after an impressive header by Ahmed Longmire on a corner kick.\n\nTwo plumes of smoke burst out behind the goal on each score.\n\nAn hour before the game, fans formed a long line outside the west end of the stadium.\n\nSeason ticket holder Scott Linklater and his wife, Hillary Linklater, were two of them.\n\n\"We've been very excited about Velocity and professional soccer coming to Spokane for a long time, so this is a big day and the weather cooperated,\" Scott Linklater said. \"What a beautiful day.\"\n\nLinklater, wearing a wool kilt and Velocity scarf, was one of many fans who walked from the St. Patrick's Day parade in downtown Spokane through Riverfront Park, across the Spokane River and into the metal bleachers and seats of ONE Spokane Stadium.\n\n\"I think a lot of these folks are just excited to be a part of something for the first time,\" Linklater said.\n\nHe said soccer brings people together.\n\n\"For whatever reason, it's become the language internationally for a lot of people, and I think it'll do the same for Spokane,\" Linklater said.\n\nLena Cooley couldn't contain her excitement, calling the first home game a \"dream come true\" as she smiled in her Velocity shirt, scarf and bucket hat.\n\nShe's lived in Spokane 35 years and has coached, officiated and promoted the sport the entire time.\n\nShe's a member of the American Outlaws, a nonprofit group that supports soccer across the country, and the 509 Syndicate, which supports the Velocity and the future women's USL W League's Spokane Zephyr FC.\n\nCooley, a season ticket holder, said she was like a child the night before Christmas and could not sleep Friday night in anticipation of Saturday's home opener.\n\n\"This is the first time I've seen Spokane truly embrace soccer and there aren't words,\" she said. \"Like I said, I'm bouncing up and down.\"\n\nWith sunny skies and temperatures in the 60s, lines at concessions stands were long as people waited for beer and other cold drinks.\n\nTony Berry and his two young children, all wearing black Velocity shirts, were sitting on the second-level west bleachers waiting for the game to start.\n\nHe said he and his children are Seattle Sounders fans and love the U.S. national teams. His children play the sport, too.\n\n\"But it's cool to have something like this here that we can come support and see and be right up close,\" said Berry, a season ticket holder, who also watched the parade with his family before coming to the game.\n\nHe said Spokane supports soccer and the sport is growing across the nation.\n\n\"I think (Spokane) is a soccer town and I think people will rally behind this,\" said Berry, noting the sold-out game and number of season ticket holders.\n\nChris Lee, who also has season tickets, grew up in Portland and is a big Portland Timbers fan. He said he's hoping for an exciting brand of soccer this season.\n\n\"It's very cool to be able to come down and watch some soccer and have a pro team,\" he said.",

        "body": "A Queens neighborhood in New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's congressional district was likened by locals to a \"third world\" country with people selling good on the sidewalks and prostitutes openly soliciting sex.\n\nThe widely vibrant and diverse communities of Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst in northwestern Queens appear to have descended into an open flea market, according to video obtained by Fox News.\n\nLocal resident Ramses Frías, a Democrat-turned-Republican who is running for the Assembly District 39 seat to clean up his community's streets, filmed blocks and blocks of illegal vendors selling clothes, sneakers, toys and snacks.\n\n\"Like most of my like-minded residents, we see this as a third-world market,\" Frías, 43, told Fox News Digital. \"Basically, you just see clothes thrown across the floor ... the items are stolen from donation bins or stolen from stores, and they just set up shop outside brick-and-mortar businesses. They take away trade from these businesses and don't pay taxes.\"\n\n\"There are no repercussions; they get a free pass,\" says Frías, who says the streets have become overrun by illegal street vendors while crime has been steadily increasing in the neighborhood.\n\nOn Wednesday, what appeared to be sex workers were filmed outside of businesses soliciting sex from men, who residents say then go back to makeshift brothels for sex, according to Frias.\n\n\"They do whatever they please, they are open about it and not discreet,\" Frías told the outlet. \"They line up all along 90th street in front of a pizzeria, a 99-cent store and just try to pull men. You'll see multiple women in scantily clad clothing. Now it's cold, they are a bit covered up, but it will get worse in the summer.\"\n\nOnly licensed vendors are permitted to sell food or goods in public spaces in New York -- and prostitution is illegal in the Empire State.\n\nResidents say that illegal migrants without permits to work have been left to hit the streets to make a living.\n\nIn January, NYPD busted a dozen brothels posing as massage parlors that were operating in \"inhumane conditions\" in a weeklong takedown.\n\nMayor Eric Adams blamed the rise of prostitution in the neighborhood on an influx of female Venezuelan migrants who are struggling to find other work in the Big Apple.\n\nAdams said the surge in \"illegal\" activity taking place on street corners in Corona is just \"one example\" of how the nation's ongoing migrant crisis is crippling the city.\n\n\"This is what happens when you create an atmosphere that people can't provide for themselves -- you can't work, you can't provide for your job and have to turn to illegal activities to do so,\" the mayor told reporters following January's brothel crackdown.",

        "title": "Alec Baldwin asks judge to dismiss charges in 'Rust' shooting",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES, March 17 -- Actor Alec Baldwin's lawyers on Thursday asked a judge to dismiss manslaughter charges against him for the 2021 fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during filming of the Western movie Rust, alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nTrial is set for July 10 in New Mexico.\n\n\"Enough is enough. This is an abuse of the system, and an abuse of an innocent person whose rights have been trampled to the extreme,\" said the motion, filed eight days after a jury found the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a separate trial.\n\nHutchins died when the reproduction Colt. 45 revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with fired a live round that also wounded director Joel Souza.\n\nCriminal defendants routinely seek to dismiss charges, which judges rarely do. But charges against Baldwin were dropped once already and the trial of Gutierrez was Hollywood's first for an on-set fatal shooting in nearly 30 years. She is due to be sentenced on April 15 and faces up to 18 months in state prison.\n\nBaldwin's lawyers argued that prosecutors have \"publicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties.\"\n\nApart from those broadsides, defence lawyers offered legal arguments including that the state withheld \"substantial exculpatory and favourable evidence\" from the grand jury.\n\nFor example, they said prosecutors failed to call a witness who would have testified that Baldwin's role as producer was purely for creative purposes and he had no role in enforcing safety protocols or hiring crew.\n\nThey cited precedents where judges dismissed indictments when prosecutors kept evidence favourable to the defence from being heard by the grand jury.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey said she would respond in court and had 14 days to file a reply.\n\nIn New Mexico, defence lawyers can call witnesses to a grand jury if the defendant testifies. In Baldwin's case, he did not take the stand at the January grand jury proceeding.\n\nProsecutors must alert the grand jury of witnesses and evidence the defence has presented and give jurors the chance to hear those witnesses and see evidence, if requested.\n\nBaldwin faces two counts of manslaughter, one for negligent use of a firearm and another for failure to exercise due caution. The fourth-degree felonies carry a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison.\n\nBaldwin was first charged with involuntary manslaughter in January of 2023. The charge was dismissed three months later when his lawyers presented evidence the revolver Baldwin was using had been modified and it could fire without the trigger being pulled.\n\nThe 30 Rock actor has denied responsibility for Hutchins' death, saying the gun went off without him pulling the trigger.\n\nMorrissey in January called a grand jury to indict Baldwin after an independent test of the gun found it would not fire without the trigger being pulled. The test confirmed a previous FBI examination. -- Reuters",

          "body": "Reuters is an international news organisation owned by Thomson Reuters\n\nActor Alec Baldwin's lawyers on Thursday asked a judge to dismiss manslaughter charges against him for the 2021 fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during filming of the Western movie 'Rust', alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\"Enough is enough. This is an abuse of the system and an abuse of an innocent person whose rights have been trampled to the extreme,\" said the motion, filed eight days after a jury found the film's armourer Hannah Gutierrez guilty of involuntary manslaughter in a separate trial.\n\nHutchins died when the reproduction Colt. 45 revolver Baldwin was rehearsing with fired a live round that also wounded director Joel Souza.\n\nCriminal defendants routinely seek to dismiss charges, which judges rarely do. But charges against Baldwin were dropped once already and the trial of Gutierrez was Hollywood's first for an on-set fatal shooting in nearly 30 years. She is due to be sentenced on April 15 and faces up to 18 months in state prison.\n\nAlec Baldwin's lawyers argued that prosecutors have 'publicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties'. Apart from those broadsides, defence lawyers offered legal arguments including that the state withheld 'substantial exculpatory and favourable evidence' from the grand jury.\n\nFor example, they said prosecutors failed to call a witness who would have testified that Baldwin's role as producer was purely for creative purposes and he had no role in enforcing safety protocols or hiring a crew.\n\nThey cited precedents where judges dismissed indictments when prosecutors kept evidence favourable to the defence from being heard by the grand jury.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey said she would respond in court and had 14 days to file a reply.\n\nIn New Mexico, defence lawyers can call witnesses to a grand jury if the defendant testifies. In Baldwin's case, he did not take the stand at the January grand jury proceeding.\n\nProsecutors must alert the grand jury of witnesses and evidence the defence has presented and give jurors the chance to hear those witnesses and see evidence if requested.\n\nBaldwin faces two counts of manslaughter, one for negligent use of a firearm and another for failure to exercise due caution. The fourth-degree felonies carry a maximum sentence of 18 months in prison.\n\nBaldwin was first charged with involuntary manslaughter in January of 2023. The charge was dismissed three months later when his lawyers presented evidence the revolver Baldwin was using had been modified and it could fire without the trigger being pulled.\n\nThe '30 Rock' actor has denied responsibility for Hutchins' death, saying the gun went off without him pulling the trigger.\n\nMorrissey in January called a grand jury to indict Baldwin after an independent test of the gun found it would not fire without the trigger being pulled. The test confirmed a previous FBI examination.",

        "title": "Kendric Davis' triple-double leads Santa Cruz Warriors to sixth straight win | NBA G league",
        "body": "SANTA CRUZ -- The shortest player on the basketball court delivered Santa Cruz one of its top performances of the season, and the streaking Warriors pulled away from G League Ignite for a 131-107 win Friday night.\n\nKendric Davis, a 5-foot-11 guard, wasn't messin' around and recorded his team team's first triple-double of the season. He finished with 15 points and season-highs of 16 assists and 10 rebounds, which thrilled the capacity crowd gathered at Kaiser Permanente Arena.\n\nYes, it was a good day for Davis and the Warriors (18-11), who sit in third place in the Western Conference, 1.5 games behind lead the Stockton Kings (19-9) with five games remaining.\n\n\"We watched film on our offense,\" Davis said. \"I think the past few games we've been barely at 100 (points). It ain't been our way. It ain't been what we've been all year. So today we had a pretty detailed film session. I thought first half or pace was back to normal; we didn't make shots. So I knew eventually the shots would start falling.\"\n\nThe Warriors outscored Ignite 73-56 in the second half.\n\nThe Warriors, battling to finish in the top six in the standings two weeks ago, now find themselves in contention for the top seed. They play the Kings in a two-game set at Adventist Health Arena in Stockton on Thursday and Saturday, return to Santa Cruz to take on the South Bay Lakers (16-12) in their regular-season home finale March 27, and close the campaign with two games at Rip City Remix (16-11) at Chiles Center in Portland, Oregon, on March 29 and 30.\n\n\"We've got five games left, all against teams in the playoff race,\" said Nicholas Kerr, the Warriors' first-year head coach, \"teams that we need to finish ahead of, so take of business and see where we end up.\"\n\nIgnite (2-28), owner of the league's worst record, suffered its 10th straight loss.\n\nDavis did everything against Ignite. He led the offense and shined in transition, he set up teammates, hit the boards, took a charge, made and-one baskets and the ensuing free throws, had three steals ...\n\nWell, almost everything. He went 0-for-7 shooting on 3-point attempts. That stat caught Kerr off guard when he glanced at the final stat sheet.\n\n\"He was phenomenal,\" said Kerr, who kept Davis in to get hit 10th rebound and then pulled him with 4:09 remaining.\n\n\"It felt good,\" said Davis, of his outing, \"but I'm hard on myself. I went 0 for 7 on 3. And I pride myself on making shots. So that's something I can look at, get better at, come in tomorrow and get a couple makes and keep getting better.\"\n\nDavis' teammates picked up the slack on the perimeter. Javan Johnson was 6-of-9 shooting from beyond the arc and finished with 22 points, and forward Gui Santos, on assignment from Golden State, made four of his six attempts and finished with 25 points. Donovan Williams had two 3s and scored a game-high 26 points.\n\nWhile Davis took part in post-game interviews, several of his teammates didn't say his name as they walked by him on their way to the locker room. Instead, they yelled \"triple-double.\"\n\nDavis wasn't the only one setting up teammates. Two-way guard Pat Spencer had six assists and scored 15 points in 27 minutes off the bench. Santos also has six assists and the Warriors finished with 37 while only turning the ball over six times.\n\nReserve Jackson Rowe had 11 points and nine rebounds, helping the Warriors win the battle on the glass 44-40. Center Amida Brimah the G League's newly crowned career shot blocks leader added four more to his total and pulled down six rebounds. Marcus Burk also scored 11 points.\n\nThe Warriors are playing their best basketball when it matters most. They're 6-1 since getting blasted by host Oklahoma City 160-107 on Feb. 28.\n\n\"This group, we have a competitive group,\" Davis said. \"Surprisingly, we have no call-ups yet, 10 days, two-ways, whatever the case may be, but we continue to stick together. Nick preaches good basketball. ... We like each other on and off the court and I think that helps us on the court.\"\n\nIzan Almansa had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Babacar Sane also scored 21 points to lead Ignite. London Johnson had 16 points and eight assists after coming off the bench. Fellow reserve Will Davis scored 12 points, and Michael Frazier II and Gabe York each chipped in with 10 points.",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tyon Grant-Foster scored 22 points, Ray Harrison added 15 of his 19 in the second half and top-seeded Grand Canyon beat UT Arlington 89-74 Saturday night to win the Western Athletic Conference Tournament for the second consecutive season and clinch an automatic berth in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Lopes have appeared five of the last six WAC Tournament title games, winning three of the last four.\n\nLok Wur scored 16 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. 14 for Grand Canyon (29-4).\n\nPhillip Russell led UT Arlington (20-14) with 22 points, including four 3-pointers. Shemar Wilson added 13 points and Akili Vining 10.\n\nHarrison converted a three-point play and followed with two free throws to open the second half as Grand Canyon scored 14 of the first 21 points to open its biggest lead at 50-39 with 15 minutes to play. Brandyn Talbot answered with two free throws before Phillip Russell hit a 3 to trim the deficit to six points a minute later and made another from beyond the arc to make it 68-64 with 4 minutes remaining.\n\nMcGlothan answered with a monstrous two-hand dunk before Talbot hit another 3 to cut UTA's deficit to three points but Harrison hit two free throws and the Mavericks committed turnovers on their next two possessions and, each time, Grant-Foster hit two free throws before Harrison made a layup to cap an 8-0 run and make it 78-67 with 1:43 to go.\n\nMoore threw down a fast-break dunk with 2.9 seconds left that stretched Grand Canyon's lead to 86-74 -- the Lopes' biggest of the game. Russell, who apparently took umbrage with the play, seemed to intentionally bump Moore, who was then hit with the ball following a baseball pass by Vining. Moore was assessed a Flagrant-2 foul, Vining a technical foul and both players were ejected.\n\nDerrick Michael Xzavierro, who didn't play for Grand Canyon, was also ejected for leaving the bench area.\n\nUT Arlington shot 49% (25 of 51) from the field and limited the Lopes to just 40% (23 of 58) shooting but the Mavericks were outscored 37-14 from the free-throw line, where GCU attempted a Division-I program record 50 shots.\n\nGrand Canyon scored 32 points off 26 Mavericks turnovers and committed 14, which UTA converted into just 11 points.\n\nNo. 3 seed UT Arlington made its only NCAA Tournament appearance when the Mavericks won the 2008 Southland Conference Tournament. UTA joined the WAC prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\n___\n\nGet alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

        "title": "Gemini's flawed AI racial images seen as warning of tech titans' power",
        "body": "Austin - For people at the trend-setting tech festival here, the scandal that erupted after Google's Gemini chatbot cranked out images of Black and Asian Nazi soldiers was seen as a warning about the power artificial intelligence can give tech titans.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai last month slammed as \"completely unacceptable\" errors by his company's Gemini AI app, after gaffes such as the images of ethnically diverse Nazi troops forced it to temporarily stop users from creating pictures of people.\n\nSocial media users mocked and criticized Google for the historically inaccurate images, like those showing a female black US senator from the 1800s -- when the first such senator was not elected until 1992.\n\n\"We definitely messed up on the image generation,\" Google co-founder Sergey Brin said at a recent AI \"hackathon,\" adding that the company should have tested Gemini more thoroughly.\n\nFolks interviewed at the popular South by Southwest arts and tech festival in Austin said the Gemini stumble highlights the inordinate power a handful of companies have over the artificial intelligence platforms that are poised to change the way people live and work.\n\n\"Essentially, it was too 'woke,'\" said Joshua Weaver, a lawyer and tech entrepreneur, meaning Google had gone overboard in its effort to project inclusion and diversity.\n\nGoogle quickly corrected its errors, but the underlying problem remains, said Charlie Burgoyne, chief executive of the Valkyrie applied science lab in Texas.\n\nHe equated Google's fix of Gemini to putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\n\nWhile Google long had the luxury of having time to refine its products, it is now scrambling in an AI race with Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic and others, Weaver noted, adding, \"They are moving faster than they know how to move.\"\n\nMistakes made in an effort at cultural sensitivity are flashpoints, particularly given the tense political divisions in the United States, a situation exacerbated by Elon Musk's X platform, the former Twitter.\n\n\"People on Twitter are very gleeful to celebrate any embarrassing thing that happens in tech,\" Weaver said, adding that reaction to the Nazi gaffe was \"overblown.\"\n\nThe mishap did, however, call into question the degree of control those using AI tools have over information, he maintained.\n\nIn the coming decade, the amount of information -- or misinformation -- created by AI could dwarf that generated by people, meaning those controlling AI safeguards will have huge influence on the world, Weaver said.\n\n- Bias-in, Bias-out -\n\nKaren Palmer, an award-winning mixed-reality creator with Interactive Films Ltd., said she could imagine a future in which someone gets into a robo-taxi and, \"if the AI scans you and thinks that there are any outstanding violations against you... you'll be taken into the local police station,\" not your intended destination.\n\nAI is trained on mountains of data and can be put to work on a growing range of tasks, from image or audio generation to determining who gets a loan or whether a medical scan detects cancer.\n\nBut that data comes from a world rife with cultural bias, disinformation and social inequity -- not to mention online content that can include casual chats between friends or intentionally exaggerated and provocative posts -- and AI models can echo those flaws.\n\nWith Gemini, Google engineers tried to rebalance the algorithms to provide results better reflecting human diversity.\n\nThe effort backfired.\n\n\"It can really be tricky, nuanced and subtle to figure out where bias is and how it's included,\" said technology lawyer Alex Shahrestani, a managing partner at Promise Legal law firm for tech companies.\n\nEven well-intentioned engineers involved with training AI can't help but bring their own life experience and subconscious bias to the process, he and others believe.\n\nValkyrie's Burgoyne also castigated big tech for keeping the inner workings of generative AI hidden in \"black boxes,\" so users are unable to detect any hidden biases.\n\n\"The capabilities of the outputs have far exceeded our understanding of the methodology,\" he said.\n\nExperts and activists are calling for more diversity in teams creating AI and related tools, and greater transparency as to how they work -- particularly when algorithms rewrite users' requests to \"improve\" results.\n\nA challenge is how to appropriately build in perspectives of the world's many and diverse communities, Jason Lewis of the Indigenous Futures Resource Center and related groups said here.\n\nAt Indigenous AI, Jason works with farflung indigenous communities to design algorithms that use their data ethically while reflecting their perspectives on the world, something he does not always see in the \"arrogance\" of big tech leaders.\n\nHis own work, he told a group, stands in \"such a contrast from Silicon Valley

          "title": "Gemini's flawed AI racial images seen as warning of tech titans' power",
          "body": "For people at the trend-setting tech festival here, the scandal that erupted after Google's Gemini chatbot cranked out images of Black and Asian Nazi soldiers was seen as a warning about the power artificial intelligence can give tech titans.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai last month slammed as \"completely unacceptable\" errors by his company's Gemini AI app, after gaffes such as the images of ethnically diverse Nazi troops forced it to temporarily stop users from creating pictures of people.\n\nSocial media users mocked and criticized Google for the historically inaccurate images, like those showing a female black US senator from the 1800s -- when the first such senator was not elected until 1992.\n\n\"We definitely messed up on the image generation,\" Google co-founder Sergey Brin said at a recent AI \"hackathon,\" adding that the company should have tested Gemini more thoroughly.\n\nFolks interviewed at the popular South by Southwest arts and tech festival in Austin said the Gemini stumble highlights the inordinate power a handful of companies have over the artificial intelligence platforms that are poised to change the way people live and work.\n\n\"Essentially, it was too 'woke,'\" said Joshua Weaver, a lawyer and tech entrepreneur, meaning Google had gone overboard in its effort to project inclusion and diversity.\n\nGoogle quickly corrected its errors, but the underlying problem remains, said Charlie Burgoyne, chief executive of the Valkyrie applied science lab in Texas.\n\nHe equated Google's fix of Gemini to putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\n\nWhile Google long had the luxury of having time to refine its products, it is now scrambling in an AI race with Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic and others, Weaver noted, adding, \"They are moving faster than they know how to move.\"\n\nMistakes made in an effort at cultural sensitivity are flashpoints, particularly given the tense political divisions in the United States, a situation exacerbated by Elon Musk's X platform, the former Twitter.\n\n\"People on Twitter are very gleeful to celebrate any embarrassing thing that happens in tech,\" Weaver said, adding that reaction to the Nazi gaffe was \"overblown.\"\n\nThe mishap did, however, call into question the degree of control those using AI tools have over information, he maintained.\n\nIn the coming decade, the amount of information -- or misinformation -- created by AI could dwarf that generated by people, meaning those controlling AI safeguards will have huge influence on the world, Weaver said.\n\n- Bias-in, Bias-out -\n\nKaren Palmer, an award-winning mixed-reality creator with Interactive Films Ltd., said she could imagine a future in which someone gets into a robo-taxi and, \"if the AI scans you and thinks that there are any outstanding violations against you... you'll be taken into the local police station,\" not your intended destination.\n\nAI is trained on mountains of data and can be put to work on a growing range of tasks, from image or audio generation to determining who gets a loan or whether a medical scan detects cancer.\n\nBut that data comes from a world rife with cultural bias, disinformation and social inequity -- not to mention online content that can include casual chats between friends or intentionally exaggerated and provocative posts -- and AI models can echo those flaws.\n\nWith Gemini, Google engineers tried to rebalance the algorithms to provide results better reflecting human diversity.\n\nThe effort backfired.\n\n\"It can really be tricky, nuanced and subtle to figure out where bias is and how it's included,\" said technology lawyer Alex Shahrestani, a managing partner at Promise Legal law firm for tech companies.\n\nEven well-intentioned engineers involved with training AI can't help but bring their own life experience and subconscious bias to the process, he and others believe.\n\nValkyrie's Burgoyne also castigated big tech for keeping the inner workings of generative AI hidden in \"black boxes,\" so users are unable to detect any hidden biases.\n\n\"The capabilities of the outputs have far exceeded our understanding of the methodology,\" he said.\n\nExperts and activists are calling for more diversity in teams creating AI and related tools, and greater transparency as to how they work -- particularly when algorithms rewrite users' requests to \"improve\" results.\n\nA challenge is how to appropriately build in perspectives of the world's many and diverse communities, Jason Lewis of the Indigenous Futures Resource Center and related groups said here.\n\nAt Indigenous AI, Jason works with farflung indigenous communities to design algorithms that use their data ethically while reflecting their perspectives on the world, something he does not always see in the \"arrogance\" of big tech leaders.\n\nHis own work, he told a group, stands in \"such a contrast from Silicon Valley rhetoric, where there's a top-down 'Oh, we're doing this because we're going to benefit all humanity' bullshit, right?\"",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Golden State star Stephen Curry returned to the starting lineup on Saturday when the Warriors faced the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe two-time MVP scored 31 points in Golden State's 128-121 victory at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nHe had missed the last three games after he sprained his right ankle late in the fourth quarter during a March 7 game against the Chicago Bulls. Curry has dealt with the same ankle injury several times during his 15-year career, including missing three games earlier this season.\n\nCurry, who turned 36 on Thursday, was cleared to resume on-court activity on Tuesday and practiced with the team on Friday in Los Angeles. An MRI on Curry's ankle last week revealed no structural damage.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr said in his pregame remarks that he expected Curry to play, but wanted to see how Curry went through pregame warmups before inserting him into the starting five. Curry entered the game 10th in the league in scoring, averaging 26.9 points.\n\nDraymond Green also returned to the lineup after missing Wednesday's 109-99 loss at Dallas due to back soreness.\n\nThe Warriors are sitting 10th in the Western Conference.",

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Golden State star Stephen Curry returned to the starting lineup on Saturday when the Warriors faced the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe two-time MVP missed the last three games after he sprained his right ankle late in the fourth quarter during a March 7 game against the Chicago Bulls. Curry has dealt with the same ankle injury several times during his 15-year career, including missing three games earlier this season.\n\nCurry, who turned 36 on Thursday, was cleared to resume on-court activity on Tuesday and practiced with the team on Friday in Los Angeles. An MRI on Curry's ankle last week revealed no structural damage.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr said in his pregame remarks that he expected Curry to play, but wanted to see how Curry went through pregame warmups before inserting him into the starting five. Curry is 10th in the league in scoring, averaging 26.9 points.\n\nDraymond Green also returned to the lineup after missing Wednesday's 109-99 loss at Dallas due to back soreness.\n\nThe Warriors are sitting 10th in the Western Conference.",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES, March 17 -- Actor Pierce Brosnan has said he deeply regrets walking off trail in Yellowstone National Park in the United States after he was fined by a court in Wyoming for getting too close to a thermal area.\n\nBrosnan, 70, pleaded guilty to foot travel in a thermal area and was fined US$500 and required to pay a US$1,000 community service payment to the Yellowstone Forever Geological Fund, the US Attorney's Office, District of Wyoming, said Thursday.\n\nCiting court documents, it said the James Bond actor had in November uploaded photos to Instagram of himself \"standing on a Yellowstone National Park thermal feature at Mammoth Hot Springs\", referring to the scenic area in the park's northern part.\n\n\"There are signs posted in the area that warn visitors of the dangers of thermal features and state that visitors must remain on the designated boardwalks and trails,\" it said.\n\nWalking off trail in such thermal areas can be perilous as the ground is fragile and the water extremely hot.\n\nPosting on his Instagram page late on Thursday, Brosnan said he was \"an environmentalist\" who had \"the utmost respect for and love of our natural world\".\n\n\"However, I made an impulsive mistake -- one that I do not take lightly -- when entering a thermal area covered in snow in Yellowstone National Park to take a photograph. I did not see a 'No Trespassing' sign posted that warned of danger nor did I hike in the immediate area,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I deeply regret my transgression and offer my heartfelt apologies to all for trespassing in this sensitive area. Yellowstone and all our National Parks are to be cared for and preserved for all to enjoy.\"",

        "body": "IQNA - In Bridgeport, Connecticut, an incident at Masjid An Noor has raised concerns within the local Muslim community.\n\nA bag containing pork, a substance forbidden in Islam, was placed at the mosque's entrance. The act, captured on surveillance, is being perceived as an intentional affront, particularly as it coincides with the observance of Ramadan.\n\nFarhan Memon, the chairperson of the Connecticut chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CT), condemned the act as a deliberate expression of hatred and intimidation.\n\n\"Leaving a bag of pork at a mosque, especially during the sacred month of Ramadan, is a blatant act of hate, disrespect and intimidation,\" he said.\n\nMemon emphasized the incident's gravity, not as an \"isolated\" event but as a \"targeted\" attempt to disrupt Muslim religious practices.\n\nRead More:\n\nCAIR-CT has appealed for an investigation by law enforcement, classifying the event as a potential hate crime, and has called for public assistance in identifying the individual responsible.\n\nThe rights group recently released new civil rights data showing that it has received 3,578 complaints during the last three months of 2023 amid an ongoing wave of anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate.",

        "body": "Washington - The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its key lending rate unchanged again on Wednesday, as policymakers continue discussions over when to start rate cuts and launch the next phase in their long-running battle against inflation.\n\nThe Fed has raised interest rates to a 23-year high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent as it looks to return inflation firmly to its long-term target of two percent.\n\nAfter making significant progress against rising prices last year, 2024 has been more challenging, with the US seeing a small uptick in the pace of monthly inflation.\n\nAt the same time, the unemployment rate has remained low, wage growth has eased, and economic growth for the final quarter of 2023 came in above expectations -- all indications that the US economy remains in good health despite higher rates.\n\nAfter two days of discussions, the Fed will publish an updated summary of economic projections (SEP) alongside its rate decision on Wednesday, which will include policymakers' views of where they expect interest rates to be at the end of this year.\n\n\"The pace of disinflation, the slowdown in employment growth, [is] not happening as fast as we thought it did a few months ago,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Michael Pugliese told AFP. \"And so they're gonna fine-tune their policy outlook accordingly.\"\n\n- From three to two? -\n\nIn December's SEP, policymakers penciled in three interest rate cuts for 2024, as the Fed moves to ease monetary policy while continuing to push inflation down towards its long-run target.\n\nThe March update published Wednesday is unlikely to show a significant shift, although some analysts see a chance that the policymakers could reduce the number of cuts they expect to see this year.\n\nWells Fargo still expects the Fed to pencil in three interest rate cuts for 2024, Pugliese said. This is one less than the bank's own prediction of four rate cuts this year.\n\nHowever, policymakers are more likely to lower their expectations for rate cuts on Wednesday than they are to raise them, he added.\n\n\"Looking at the projections, we do think there is a risk that we see two rate cuts instead of three,\" EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour told AFP.\n\n\"We've got a lot of noise in the inflation data and some upside surprises,\" she said. \"So there may be some Fed officials that are inclined to adopt a bit more of a hawkish posture.\"\n\n- Path of cuts uncertain -\n\nIn recent weeks, officials at the US central bank -- led by Fed chair Jerome Powell -- have urged caution about cutting interest rates too quickly, and have instead said they will follow a \"data-dependent\" path.\n\n\"The economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our two percent inflation objective is not assured,\" Powell told lawmakers in Washington earlier this month.\n\nHe later confirmed that he still expects cuts to begin this year.\n\nFutures traders currently assign a probability of around 55 percent that the Fed will start cutting interest rates by June 12, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThis marks a significant shift from the run-up to the Fed's last rate decision in January, when traders were still widely anticipating the first would come in May.\n\n\"We were thinking May; we've moved that back to June,\" Kathy Bostjancic from Nationwide told AFP. \"And if it's not June, I think July.\"\n\n\"I think they're really going to be inclined to remain in this wait-and-see mode, and wait for more data to really make that move,\" said EY's Boussour, who also expects the Fed's first rate cut to come in June.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON: Alex Pearlman shut the door on dreams of a standup comedy career almost a decade ago, pivoting from the stage to an office cubicle where he worked a customer service job.\n\nThen he started posting random jokes and commentary about pop culture and politics on TikTok. Just over 2.5 million followers later, he quit his nine-to-five and recently booked his first nationwide tour.\n\nPearlman is among the many TikTok creators across the U.S. outraged over a bipartisan bill passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday that would lead to a nationwide ban of the popular video app if its China-based owner, ByteDance, doesn't sell its stake. The bill still needs to go through the Senate, where its prospects are unclear.\n\nContent creators say a ban would hurt countless people and businesses that rely on TikTok for a significant portion of their income, while also arguing TikTok has become an unrivaled platform for dialogue and community.\n\nPearlman, who lives outside Philadelphia, said TikTok has transformed his life, allowing him to live a dream, provide for his family and spend the first three months of his newborn son's life at home. His customer service job only offered paternity leave equivalent to three weeks off, with two weeks paid.\n\n\"I don't take a day for granted on this app, because it's been so shocking,\" said Pearlman, 39. \"In reality, TikTok has been the driver of American social media for the last four years. Something will step into that place if TikTok vanishes tomorrow. Whether or not that will be better or worse, Congress has no way of knowing.\"\n\nTikTok, which launched in 2016, has skyrocketed in popularity, growing faster than Instagram, YouTube or Facebook. The push to remove the app from Chinese authority follows concerns from lawmakers, law enforcement and intelligence officials about the insecurity of user data, potential suppression of content unfavorable to the Chinese government and the possibility that the platform could boost pro-Beijing propaganda, all of which TikTok denies.\n\nTo date, the U.S. government hasn't provided any evidence showing TikTok shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities.\n\nThe move comes as the pandemic saw huge growth in digital marketing as people were stuck at home consuming -- and creating -- content at levels not seen before.\n\nJensen Savannah, a 29-year-old from Charlotte, began making TikToks of her travels around the Carolinas during the pandemic. Now a full-time influencer, she has tripled her income since leaving her telecommunications sales job.\n\n\"'Social media Influencer' is almost to be looked at as the new print and the new form of radio and TV advertising,\" she said. \"It's going to bring your dollar much farther than it is in traditional marketing.\"\n\nSome creators describe it as a digital equalizer of sorts, providing a platform for people of color and other marginalized groups to get opportunities and exposure.\n\n\"I've always had Twitter, I've had Facebook, I've had Instagram. But TikTok was the first one where, if you want to find somebody who looks like yourself and represents you in any type of way, you can find it,\" said Joshua Dairen, a Black, 30-year-old content creator in Auburn, Alabama. Dairen makes videos about his state's ghost stories, urban legends and history.\n\nGrowing up, he loved researching everything paranormal, but he didn't see a lot of Black representation in the field. Exposure on TikTok has led to jobs writing freelance pieces and contributing to documentaries about paranormal occurrences and unsolved mysteries. The app also gave Dairen the flexibility and confidence to open his own coffee shop, where he gets visits at least once a day from fans of his work.\n\nHe thinks banning TikTok sets \"a dangerous precedent about how much power our highest levels of government can wield.\"\n\nOthers say the app is both a financial and social safety net.\n\nChris Bautista, a food truck owner in Los Angeles catering to television and movie sets, started using TikTok during the pandemic to connect with members of the LGBTQ+ community and show support for those who might be having a hard time.\n\nBautista, 37, grew up in a conservative Christian community outside LA and didn't come out until his late 20s. As a young person, he struggled with his mental health and considered suicide. He wanted to create a platform he could have used as a teenager, one showing that someone like him could go to that dark place and come out the other side a \"well-adjusted, confident person.\"\n\n\"I just find the corners of TikTok that I find myself in to be so wildly important and profound,\" according to Bautista, who said it would be \"heartbreaking\" if the app was banned.\n\nBautista didn't start posting with the intention of monetizing the experience, but money from projects tied to the app came at the right time: If it wasn't for the extra income he earned through TikTok during the pandemic and then the Hollywood strikes last year, his business would have shut down.\n\nAlmost since its inception, concerns have been raised about the addictive nature of the app, especially for young audiences whose minds are still developing. Marcus Bridgewater, a former private school teacher and administrator who owns his own business and posts TikTok gardening videos, wants Congress to be focused on those issues, and not whether the app is Chinese-owned.\n\n\"Social media is a powerful tool,\" said Bridgewater, who lives in Spring, Texas. \"And powerful tools are just that: They are capable of helping us transcend ourselves, but in their transcendence, they're also capable of completely severing us from those we love.\"\n\nPearlman said he has long feared politicians would come after TikTok. He compared the experience of finding out about the House vote to finally getting the call that an ailing loved one has died.\n\n\"The part that's disturbing to me is, I feel like for a lot of Americans, TikTok and social media in general is a release valve -- it's kind of become a default complaint box,\" he said. \"So to many people, it feels like they're trying to ban the complaint box instead of dealing with the complaint.\"",

          "body": "Alex Pearlman shut the door on dreams of a standup comedy career almost a decade ago, pivoting from the stage to an office cubicle where he worked a customer service job.\n\nThen he started posting random jokes and commentary about pop culture and politics on TikTok. Just over 2.5 million followers later, he quit his nine-to-five and recently booked his first nationwide tour.\n\nPearlman is among the many TikTok creators across the U.S. outraged over a bipartisan bill passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday that would lead to a nationwide ban of the popular video app if its China-based owner, ByteDance, doesn't sell its stake. The bill still needs to go through the Senate, where its prospects are unclear.\n\nContent creators say a ban would hurt countless people and businesses that rely on TikTok for a significant portion of their income, while also arguing TikTok has become an unrivaled platform for dialogue and community.\n\nPearlman, who lives outside Philadelphia, said TikTok has transformed his life, allowing him to live a dream, provide for his family and spend the first three months of his newborn son's life at home. His customer service job only offered paternity leave equivalent to three weeks off, with two weeks paid.\n\n\"I don't take a day for granted on this app, because it's been so shocking,\" said Pearlman, 39. \"In reality, TikTok has been the driver of American social media for the last four years. Something will step into that place if TikTok vanishes tomorrow. Whether or not that will be better or worse, Congress has no way of knowing.\"\n\nPHOTOS: TikTok creators warn of economic impact if app sees ban, call it a vital space for the marginalized\n\nTikTok, which launched in 2016, has skyrocketed in popularity, growing faster than Instagram, YouTube or Facebook. The push to remove the app from Chinese authority follows concerns from lawmakers, law enforcement and intelligence officials about the insecurity of user data, potential suppression of content unfavorable to the Chinese government and the possibility that the platform could boost pro-Beijing propaganda, all of which TikTok denies.\n\nTo date, the U.S. government hasn't provided any evidence showing TikTok shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities.\n\nThe move comes as the pandemic saw huge growth in digital marketing as people were stuck at home consuming - and creating - content at levels not seen before.\n\nJensen Savannah, a 29-year-old from Charlotte, began making TikToks of her travels around the Carolinas during the pandemic. Now a full-time influencer, she has tripled her income since leaving her telecommunications sales job.\n\n\"'Social media Influencer' is almost to be looked at as the new print and the new form of radio and TV advertising,\" she said. \"It's going to bring your dollar much farther than it is in traditional marketing.\"\n\nSome creators describe it as a digital equalizer of sorts, providing a platform for people of color and other marginalized groups to get opportunities and exposure.\n\n\"I've always had Twitter, I've had Facebook, I've had Instagram. But TikTok was the first one where, if you want to find somebody who looks like yourself and represents you in any type of way, you can find it,\" said Joshua Dairen, a Black, 30-year-old content creator in Auburn, Alabama. Dairen makes videos about his state's ghost stories, urban legends and history.\n\nGrowing up, he loved researching everything paranormal, but he didn't see a lot of Black representation in the field. Exposure on TikTok has led to jobs writing freelance pieces and contributing to documentaries about paranormal occurrences and unsolved mysteries. The app also gave Dairen the flexibility and confidence to open his own coffee shop, where he gets visits at least once a day from fans of his work.\n\nHe thinks banning TikTok sets \"a dangerous precedent about how much power our highest levels of government can wield.\"\n\nOthers say the app is both a financial and social safety net.\n\nChris Bautista, a food truck owner in Los Angeles catering to television and movie sets, started using TikTok during the pandemic to connect with members of the LGBTQ+ community and show support for those who might be having a hard time.\n\nBautista, 37, grew up in a conservative Christian community outside LA and didn't come out until his late 20s. As a young person, he struggled with his mental health and considered suicide. He wanted to create a platform he could have used as a teenager, one showing that someone like him could go to that dark place and come out the other side a \"well-adjusted, confident person.\"\n\n\"I just find the corners of TikTok that I find myself in to be so wildly important and profound,\" according to Bautista, who said it would be \"heartbreaking\" if the app was banned.\n\nBautista didn't start posting with the intention of monetizing the experience, but money from projects tied to the app came at the right time: If it wasn't for the extra income he earned through TikTok during the pandemic and then the Hollywood strikes last year, his business would have shut down.\n\nAlmost since its inception, concerns have been raised about the addictive nature of the app, especially for young audiences whose minds are still developing. Marcus Bridgewater, a former private school teacher and administrator who owns his own business and posts TikTok gardening videos, wants Congress to be focused on those issues, and not whether the app is Chinese-owned.\n\n\"Social media is a powerful tool,\" said Bridgewater, who lives in Spring, Texas. \"And powerful tools are just that: They are capable of helping us transcend ourselves, but in their transcendence, they're also capable of completely severing us from those we love.\"\n\nPearlman said he has long feared politicians would come after TikTok. He compared the experience of finding out about the House vote to finally getting the call that an ailing loved one has died.\n\n\"The part that's disturbing to me is, I feel like for a lot of Americans, TikTok and social media in general is a release valve - it's kind of become a default complaint box,\" he said. \"So to many people, it feels like they're trying to ban the complaint box instead of dealing with the complaint.\"",

        "body": "LONG BEACH, Calif. (KABC) -- A massive disturbance related to a brawl shut down The Pike Outlets in Long Beach Saturday afternoon, and a shooting that occurred moments later in the area left a teen boy injured.\n\nAccording to the Long Beach Police Department, a fight between a woman and a young girl broke out around 5:40 p.m. at Bay Street and Aquarium Way.\n\nVideo obtained by Eyewitness News showed hundreds of teens and young adults running around the outdoor mall, with the fight occurring as they moved around. You can see the woman and the girl lunging at each other, repeatedly throwing punches. One of them was seen bleeding.\n\nMario Carabez captured the fight on his phone. He was at The Pike with his daughter.\n\n\"Everyone ran and then within the next couple of, maybe 10 minutes, another fight broke down another couple feet from that,\" he said.\n\nPolice said officers quickly stopped the fight and arrested both the woman and the girl. It's unclear what sparked the altercation, and their identities and ages were not immediately released.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, the Long Beach Police Department posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying it was aware of a planned gathering. The \"meet-up plan\" was reportedly posted on social media.\n\n\"We have increased our presence in the area. Criminal activity will not be tolerated.\"\n\nWitnesses told ABC7 they knew some sort of \"meet-up\" was going to happen based on the social media posts. One young boy said the post said to come to The Pike and \"fight, go stupid, get kicked out until it closes.\"\n\n\"They just always do that. I don't know why, but I just be enjoying it because it's fun,\" he said. \"They want to go viral. They do that to go viral and stuff.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kyler Kirk, who was at The Pike on a date with his girlfriend, arrived at the mall to find it completely shut down.\n\n\"When I was younger, there was no such thing as going viral trying to fight,\" he said. \"It doesn't make sense, logically, to do stuff like that. It pretty stupid to me.\"\n\nDue to the size of the crowd, multiple patrol cruisers and dozens of officers were on the property to safely clear the area. Officers warned people if anyone did not leave the property, they would face trespassing charges.\n\nPolice said it would be conducting increased patrols throughout the evening.\n\nPolice said minutes later, around 6:26 p.m., officers responded to the area near East 1st Street and The Promenade following a report of a shooting.\n\nOfficers found a boy, whose age was not immediately disclosed, with a gunshot wound to his lower body. He was rushed to the hospital where he's reportedly in stable condition.\n\nThere was no immediate information on a suspect or suspects. Investigators did find a shell casing at the scene that has since been booked as evidence.\n\nNo other injuries were reported. Both incidents remain under investigation and it's unclear if they are both connected.",

        "body": "FREDERICKSBURG -- The Spotsylvania County School Board fired Superintendent Mark Taylor during a special meeting Tuesday night.\n\nAfter a lengthy closed session, the board voted 5-0 to remove the superintendent. The board also voted to hold a hearing with Taylor, with no date set.\n\nGetting to that vote proved difficult as the board became entangled in arguments over the meeting process before going into closed session to discuss Taylor's status. And this happened with the absence of two members -- Lisa Phelps and April Gillespie -- often at odds with the board majority.\n\nIn an initial vote to terminate Taylor's contract, the board voted 4-0 with one abstention.\n\nChairwoman Lorita Daniels made the motion to terminate the contract but abstained from voting on the matter. Nicole Cole, Megan Jackson, Belen Rodas and Carol Medawar approved the contract termination.\n\nIn explaining her abstention, Daniels said she supported terminating the contract, but she disagreed with some of the causes and issues for doing so and wanted the board to get together to form a consensus.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther board members, led by Nicole Cole, were either upset, confused or uncomfortable with Daniels' handling of the agenda and meeting, which led to arguments and some emotional moments.\n\nAt one point a clearly upset Daniels said she is tired of being called out and bullied by members, especially when they chose her to be the chair. The board chair said she does not want to see the school system \"destroyed by somebody who has a chip on their shoulders ... I'm tired. Enough is enough.\"\n\nShe said board members have plenty to do for the school system and were wasting time fighting among themselves.\n\n\"Look at the children,\" she said. \"The children are important. The teachers are important.\"\n\nRegardless of the awkward discussions, the board still managed to do what it has been working on since early this year by ousting Taylor, the superintendent hired by the previous board. In November voters voted to replace three members who supported Taylor, which changed the majority of the board.\n\nTaylor has been on administrative leave since late January, when the board made the move in closed session. The former school system superintendent, who started in September 2022, caused a firestorm after removing more than 30 book titles from the county's school libraries last year.\n\nKelly Guempel, deputy superintendent and chief academic officer, was chosen as acting superintendent and has been present at school board meetings in that capacity.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "body": "Los Angeles (AFP) - Stephen Curry returned from a sprained ankle to score 31 points and reserve Klay Thompson added 26 to spark Golden State over the Los Angeles Lakers 128-121 in an NBA showdown on Saturday.\n\nThe Lakers, who lost forward Anthony Davis after the first quarter to a poke in the left eye, squandered a 40-point performance by LeBron James in falling to the Warriors.\n\n\"A big win for us,\" Curry said. \"I don't know the last time we won in here against them. Big deal.\"\n\nTwo-time NBA Most Valuable Player Curry missed Golden State's past three games and the Warriors are only 1-5 this season without him.\n\nThe 36-year-old guard and four-time NBA champion returned in spectacular fashion, adding six rebounds and five assists while hitting 12-of-24 shots from the floor, and 3-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJames, who hit 15-of-23 shots, added eight points and nine assists and filled in after Davis went to the locker room after the first quarter and did not play again.\n\n\"They always going to talk about me and him,\" Curry said of James. \"It was about our total group tonight. For us, it takes a whole team to win and we needed it -- we needed it bad.\"\n\nDraymond Green contributed 12 rebounds and 13 assists and Jonathan Kuminga added 23 points for Golden State.\n\nThe game was halted for several minutes near the end by a malfunctioning shot clock.\n\n\"I've never seen that in my career. Usually they have a back-up clock or something,\" Curry said.\n\n\"That's the worst thing that could happen, especially this age. You build up all pre-game, you get going and when the engine shuts off it's hard to get it going again.\"\n\nThe Warriors are a percentage point ahead of the Lakers in the last two play-in positions in the Western Conference.\n\nJalen Williams scored 23 points, grabbed seven rebounds and had six assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder grabbed a share of the Western Conference lead by winning 118-112 at Memphis.\n\nThe Thunder matched defending NBA champion Denver atop the West at 47-20.\n\nRookie Chet Holmgren scored 22 points and pulled down 11 rebounds while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 20 points for Oklahoma City.\n\n\"We just had to make winning plays down the stretch,\" Holmgren said. \"It wasn't going our way the whole game but we came together enough to come away with the win.\"\n\nMinnesota moved within a game of the West co-leaders as Anthony Edwards scored 31 points and Mike Conley added 25 in a 119-100 Timberwolves triumph at Utah.\n\nJalen Brunson fired in 42 points to spark the New York Knicks to a 98-91 victory at Sacramento.\n\nTyrese Maxey scored 30 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over visiting Charlotte 109-98.\n\nCameroonian forward Pascal Siakam poured in 28 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to spark host Indiana over the Brooklyn Nets 121-100.\n\nC.J. McCollum scored 30 points and passed off eight assists while Zion Williamson added 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead New Orleans over visiting Portland 126-107.\n\nJalen Green scored 26 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to lead Houston over visiting Cleveland 117-103, stretching the Rockets' win streak to five games.\n\nAyo Dosunmu scored 34 points and Nikola Vucevic added 29 points and 13 rebounds to spark the Chicago Bulls over visiting NBA doormat Washington 127-98.",

          "body": "Los Angeles (AFP) - Stephen Curry returned from a sprained ankle to score 31 points and reserve Klay Thompson added 26 to spark Golden State over the Los Angeles Lakers 128-121 in an NBA showdown on Saturday.\n\nThe Lakers, who lost forward Anthony Davis after the first quarter to a poke in the left eye, squandered a 40-point performance by LeBron James in falling to the Warriors.\n\n\"A big win for us,\" Curry said. \"I don't know the last time we won in here against them. Big deal.\"\n\nTwo-time NBA Most Valuable Player Curry missed Golden State's past three games and the Warriors are only 1-5 this season without him.\n\nThe 36-year-old guard and four-time NBA champion returned in spectacular fashion, adding six rebounds and five assists while hitting 12-of-24 shots from the floor, and 3-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJames, who hit 15-of-23 shots, added eight points and nine assists and filled in after Davis went to the locker room after the first quarter and did not play again.\n\n\"They always going to talk about me and him,\" Curry said of James. \"It was about our total group tonight. For us, it takes a whole team to win and we needed it -- we needed it bad.\"\n\nDraymond Green contributed 12 rebounds and 13 assists and Jonathan Kuminga added 23 points for Golden State.\n\nThe game was halted for several minutes near the end by a malfunctioning shot clock.\n\n\"I've never seen that in my career. Usually they have a back-up clock or something,\" Curry said.\n\n\"That's the worst thing that could happen, especially this age. You build up all pre-game, you get going and when the engine shuts off it's hard to get it going again.\"\n\nThe Warriors are a percentage point ahead of the Lakers in the last two play-in positions in the Western Conference.\n\nJalen Williams scored 23 points, grabbed seven rebounds and had six assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder grabbed a share of the Western Conference lead by winning 118-112 at Memphis.\n\nThe Thunder matched defending NBA champion Denver atop the West at 47-20.\n\nRookie Chet Holmgren scored 22 points and pulled down 11 rebounds while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 20 points for Oklahoma City.\n\n\"We just had to make winning plays down the stretch,\" Holmgren said. \"It wasn't going our way the whole game but we came together enough to come away with the win.\"\n\nMinnesota moved within a game of the West co-leaders as Anthony Edwards scored 31 points and Mike Conley added 25 in a 119-100 Timberwolves triumph at Utah.\n\nJalen Brunson fired in 42 points to spark the New York Knicks to a 98-91 victory at Sacramento.\n\nTyrese Maxey scored 30 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over visiting Charlotte 109-98.\n\nCameroonian forward Pascal Siakam poured in 28 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to spark host Indiana over the Brooklyn Nets 121-100.\n\nC.J. McCollum scored 30 points and passed off eight assists while Zion Williamson added 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead New Orleans over visiting Portland 126-107.\n\nJalen Green scored 26 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to lead Houston over visiting Cleveland 117-103, stretching the Rockets' win streak to five games.\n\nAyo Dosunmu scored 34 points and Nikola Vucevic added 29 points and 13 rebounds to spark the Chicago Bulls over visiting NBA doormat Washington 127-98.",

        "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) -- Loved ones continue to search for University of Missouri student Riley Strain one week after he was reported missing while on a fraternity trip in downtown Nashville\n\nOn Friday, March 8, the Mizzou senior was asked to leave Luke's 32 Bridge, Luke Bryan's bar on Broadway, after only being served one alcoholic drink and two waters, according to TC Restaurant Group.\n\n\"At 9:35 p.m., our security team made a decision based on our conduct standards to escort him from the venue through our Broadway exit at the front of our building. He was followed down the stairs with one member of his party. The individual with Riley did not exit and returned upstairs,\" the company said in a statement released one week after the incident.\n\nTIMELINE: The disappearance of Missouri student Riley Strain, what we know so far\n\nA friend of Strain called 911 on Saturday, March 9 after saying he went to the Central Police Precinct and called the sheriff's office to file a missing person's report.\n\nStrain's family, from Springfield, Missouri, said they drove down as soon as they got a call from his fraternity brothers last weekend about his disappearance. They have remained in Nashville all week, searching for the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's been a week, we haven't heard his voice, we haven't gotten a text from him. We're ready...[In the] middle of the night, you hear that ping, you're jumping up, you're like, 'Is it Riley? Is it somebody that knows something about Riley?' So, yeah, it's time, it's time to bring him home,\" Strain's stepfather, Chris Whiteid, told News 2 on Saturday, March 16.\n\nMissing Missouri student: Retracing Riley Strain's steps in downtown Nashville\n\nAlthough some cameras captured the soon-to-be graduate making his way through downtown, heading towards the Metro Courthouse, his family explained there are gaps and cameras pointed in the wrong direction that make it hard to know exactly where to look for Strain.\n\nOn Saturday, Strain's father, Ryan Gilbert, told News 2 the family has learned Strain's Apple Watch location services had never been set up, ruining a lead they were hoping would bring them answers.\n\n\"We're ready to get this over with. We want some answers,\" Gilbert said. \"We're a week in, it's not getting any easier. Time seems like it's really to the critical point, and we want to ask anybody, if they know anything, to please share it.\"\n\nWho is Riley Strain? Family shares more details about missing Missouri student\n\nThe Nashville Office of Emergency Management told News 2 that drones, canines, boats, and divers were used to search in and around the Cumberland River Saturday, although Strain's family doesn't believe he's in the water.\n\n\"As much searching as we've done along the river, along the hillside, talking to people, we don't believe that that's where he's at. We feel like either he slept for a few hours and got up and started wandering again, or was picked up by a car, We don't know,\" Chris said.\n\nAs family works through a grim milestone they hoped to never reach, they said the kindness of others is keeping them going. Friends and family have taken turns coming down to Tennessee to help search. In addition, complete strangers have spent hours driving to Nashville, offering their time to hand out flyers, and asking questions throughout the investigation.\n\nRiley Strain Continuing Coverage | The latest in the search for the missing Missouri student\n\n\"We just can't thank them enough. I mean, it's so amazing,\" Strain's mom, Michelle Whiteid, said.\n\n\"It restores your faith in the American people. You know, you hear so much negativity and darkness, but I can tell you it's definitely changed how I see and how I feel just by the way people are reaching out to us,\" Chris added.\n\nStrain is 6-feet, 5-inches tall, with a slender build, blonde hair, and blue eyes. If you see Strain or have any information about where he may be, you are asked to call the Metro Nashville Police Department at 615-862-8600.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WKRN News 2.",

        "title": "2024 ACC Men's Championship | NC State beats North Carolina to win ACC tournament and earn automatic NCAA bid - ExBulletin",
        "body": "WASHINGTON- This is a season to remember for NC State Wolfpack players. They beat 5 teams in 5 days to win the 2024 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) title and earn an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIt's been 37 years since the Wolfpack won an ACC championship, that was in 1987 and before any of the team's players were born.\n\nDJ Horne scored 29 points, forward DJ Burns Jr. scored 20, including the first 3-pointer of his college career, and North Carolina State returns to the NCAA Tournament after beating fourth-place North Carolina, 84-76, in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Tournament title game Saturday night.\n\nLed by both DJs, 10th-seeded NC State capped an improbable run, eliminating the Tar Heels who have looked like a national championship contender for much of the season. Horne played 32 minutes despite foul trouble, going shot for shot with UNC's unanimous ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis, who was spectacular with 30 points.\n\nAs he cheered from the crowd, fans in red chanted \"DJ Horne! DJ Horne!\" when he fouled out with 1:11 left.\n\nBut he's not done playing basketball this season.\n\n\"I can't even express it in words right now,\" Horne said. \"Just a week ago it looked like our season was about to end, and now here we are, man, on top of the world.\"\n\nAfter coach Kevin Keatts repeatedly said his team was one of many that needed to win the tournament to advance to the NCAAs, his Wolfpack (22-14) won the ACC tournament for the first time since 1987 under Jim Valvano, while playing away to Washington in 1987. Landover, Maryland.\n\nThis one went the same way: against Tar Heels, top seed and regular season champion, who had beaten the Wolfpack twice this season, just like this year.\n\nThe Wolfpack snatched an automatic bid, bursting someone's bubble and giving the ACC at least a fourth team in the NCAA Tournament alongside locks UNC, Duke and Clemson. Virginia, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest are among the teams that will sweat in selection Sunday.\n\nThat won't be the case for UNC (27-7), which likely solidified a March Madness seed by reaching the final with a rout of Florida State and then getting a star performance from Davis to beat Pitt in semi final. Davis, Armando Bacot and their teammates won the ACC regular season title, but went cold Saturday, missing 12 straight shots down the stretch.\n\nThe Wolfpack, coming off a four-game skid, became the first team to win five games in the ACC tournament. Since it's a five-day event, they were the only team to reach the finals after playing on Tuesday, beating Louisville, Syracuse, Duke and Virginia, then UNC as double-digit underdogs .\n\n\"Like I said from the jump, man, why not us?\" Horne said.\n\nThe fatigue of playing a fifth match in as many days, including overtime in the semi-final, was sometimes noticeable. But NC State came through, with plenty of volume inside Burns, a 6-foot-9, 260-pound fifth-year senior.\n\nIn addition to stopping Bacot for several baskets and tying his career high with seven assists, his 3 with the shot clock running out in the first half was his first from beyond the arc during his 160th varsity game. He's back on the court, and now he and his teammates will dance in the NCAA tournament.",

        "body": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin voters are set to decide whether to make it unconstitutional to accept private grant money to help administer state elections, one of two Republican-backed ballot measures that Democrats say are meant to make it harder to conduct elections in the presidential battleground state. A related constitutional amendment on the state's April 2 ballot would allow only election officials designated by law to administer elections. If a majority of voters approve, the amendments would be added to the state's constitution. Since 2020, Republicans in at least 27 states have outlawed or restricted private elections grants. The Wisconsin measures are opposed by an array of government watchdog and liberal groups. Early in-person absentee voting is scheduled to beginTuesday.\n\nFOX28 Spokane©",

          "body": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin voters are set to decide whether to make it unconstitutional to accept private grant money to help administer state elections, one of two Republican-backed ballot measures that Democrats say are meant to make it harder to conduct elections in the presidential battleground state. A related constitutional amendment on the state's April 2 ballot would allow only election officials designated by law to administer elections. If a majority of voters approve, the amendments would be added to the state's constitution. Since 2020, Republicans in at least 27 states have outlawed or restricted private elections grants. The Wisconsin measures are opposed by an array of government watchdog and liberal groups. Early in-person absentee voting is scheduled to beginTuesday.",

        "title": "Broken clock, reviews mar end of Lakers-Warriors",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The last two minutes of the game clock in the Golden State Warriors' 128-121 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night took more than 20 minutes of real time to play out thanks to a series of replay reviews and shot-clock malfunctions.\n\nThe delays began with 1:50 remaining in the fourth, with the Lakers trailing 124-120, when L.A. coach Darvin Ham challenged an out of bounds call that granted the Warriors possession while Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and Golden State forward Andrew Wiggins both went for the rebound.\n\nWhile the officials were reviewing the out of bounds call, they determined that the corner 3-pointer LeBron James made on the previous trip down the court with 2:07 remaining did not count.\n\nThe Lakers ended up winning the challenge -- Hayes and Wiggins faced off for a jump ball -- but lost points in the process.\n\n\"I've never seen that be called before like that -- in that particular time,\" said James, who finished with 40 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds. \"That was kind of weird. ... It took some momentum away from us.\"\n\nThe ruling was eerily similar to one from a December game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, in which a late 3 by James that would have tied the score was downgraded to a 2-pointer after review. Just like he did that night, James disagreed with the call Saturday.\n\n\"I didn't believe I stepped on the line, obviously,\" James said Saturday. \"I knew how much space I had over there. And when I shoot, I shoot on my tippy toes, so it's kind of hard for me to have a heel down.\"\n\nCrew chief David Guthrie explained the ruling in a postgame statement to a pool reporter.\n\n\"James' left foot is out of bounds as he begins to shoot,\" Guthrie said. \"Yes, it is reviewable at that time. The rule is Rule 13, Section II(f)(3): Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation, the replay center official will only look at the position of the player's feet at the moment they touch the floor immediately prior to the release of the shot. This can be applied during other replay triggers as well.\"\n\nWhile the overturned 3 helped his team, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he would just as soon lived without it.\n\n\"I also don't like the rule that you can go back and look at an out of bounds, or LeBron's 3,\" Kerr said. \"That seems to happen once or twice a year. I'd love to see that rule go away. I think we're trying so hard to get everything just right, at the expense of the flow. I mean, who cares if a guy's foot is half an inch on the line? Is that worth going back 45 seconds and changing everything, with the unintended consequences? It's not my favorite rule, for sure.\"\n\nJames, however, defended the spirit of the replay rules.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you want to get it right,\" James said. \"So, it's unfortunate what happened. But you want to try to get it right, obviously. And our crew has a job to do -- which is the referees -- they have a job to do, and they have to do it at the best they can. So, all good.\"\n\nWith the score back to 124-117 after James' 3 was nullified, Wiggins won the jump ball, tipping it to Draymond Green, who tried to corral the ball near the baseline.\n\nWhile James was penalized for the heel of his sneaker supposedly touching the side out of bounds line, the Lakers believed that the toe of Green's shoe did the same on the baseline with 1:48 remaining. So Ham used another coach's challenge.\n\nAfter another review, the referees called it out of bounds on Green, and L.A. was granted possession back. The Lakers inbounded the ball, but the officials quickly blew their whistles, noticing the shot clock was not working properly. After the refs consulted with the scoreboard operators at center court, L.A. was given the ball to inbound again, and once again, the shot clock malfunctioned after the Lakers threw it in.\n\nThe false start happened four times in a row, eliciting louder and louder boos with each delay. The ABC broadcast even cut to actor and director Ben Affleck, seated courtside with Jennifer Lopez, slumping in his chair, unable to hide his impatience. The ABC cameras also caught James shaking his head and laughing at the extended break in the action as he said, \"I'm too old for this s---.\"\n\nEventually, Crypto.com Arena public address announcer Lawrence Tanter informed the crowd he would be counting down the shot clock over the arena speakers in order to resume play.\n\nAfter all that, L.A. got the ball in and James had the ball stripped by Warriors star Stephen Curry (31 points), leading to an alley-oop dunk for Jonathan Kuminga (23 points) and putting Golden State up 126-117 with 1:07 remaining.\n\n\"It was bizarre,\" Kerr said. \"It seems like a few times a year you get clock issues. That's about as extreme as I've been a part of where the backup unit doesn't work either. It's unfortunate. I felt bad for the fans. That was a great game, and then the last two minutes everyone is just kind of looking at each other wondering what to do.\"\n\nSeveral Lakers players pointed out that the shot clock had a hiccup during a Warriors possession with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, when it was counting down from 10 to 9, reset to 24 and play continued, with Trayce Jackson-Davis finishing the possession by scoring a driving hook shot with 10:38 to put Golden State up 104-96.\n\n\"Their points didn't get taken away because the clock malfunctioned,\" Ham said. \"They continued to play through. But it is what it is.\"\n\nThat sequence was also brought up in the postgame pool report.\n\n\"The shot clock malfunctioned during live play at that time, and that is not a reviewable matter,\" Guthrie said in a statement, adding it was the responsibility of the officiating crew to notice the discrepancy in the moment, and they failed to do so.\n\nL.A. came into the night with a one game lead on Golden State for No. 9 in the Western Conference standings. Saturday's result flipped both teams' positioning, with the Lakers now in 10th with 14 games remaining.\n\n\"It's going to take everything to scrape out some wins,\" Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell (23 points, 13 assists) said. \"At this time of the year, they all matter.\"",

          "title": "Broken clock, reviews mar end of Lakers-Warriors",
          "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The last two minutes of the game clock in the Golden State Warriors' 128-121 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night took more than 20 minutes of real time to play out thanks to a series of replay reviews and shot-clock malfunctions.\n\nThe delays began with 1:50 remaining in the fourth, with the Lakers trailing 124-120, when L.A. coach Darvin Ham challenged an out of bounds call that granted the Warriors possession while Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and Golden State forward Andrew Wiggins both went for the rebound.\n\nWhile the officials were reviewing the out of bounds call, they determined that the corner 3-pointer LeBron James made on the previous trip down the court with 2:07 remaining did not count.\n\nThe Lakers ended up winning the challenge -- Hayes and Wiggins faced off for a jump ball -- but lost points in the process.\n\n\"I've never seen that be called before like that -- in that particular time,\" said James, who finished with 40 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds. \"That was kind of weird. ... It took some momentum away from us.\"\n\nThe ruling was eerily similar to one from a December game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, in which a late 3 by James that would have tied the score was downgraded to a 2-pointer after review. Just like he did that night, James disagreed with the call Saturday.\n\n\"I didn't believe I stepped on the line, obviously,\" James said Saturday. \"I knew how much space I had over there. And when I shoot, I shoot on my tippy toes, so it's kind of hard for me to have a heel down.\"\n\nCrew chief David Guthrie explained the ruling in a postgame statement to a pool reporter.\n\n\"James' left foot is out of bounds as he begins to shoot,\" Guthrie said. \"Yes, it is reviewable at that time. The rule is Rule 13, Section II(f)(3): Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation, the replay center official will only look at the position of the player's feet at the moment they touch the floor immediately prior to the release of the shot. This can be applied during other replay triggers as well.\"\n\nWhile the overturned 3 helped his team, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he would just as soon lived without it.\n\n\"I also don't like the rule that you can go back and look at an out of bounds, or LeBron's 3,\" Kerr said. \"That seems to happen once or twice a year. I'd love to see that rule go away. I think we're trying so hard to get everything just right, at the expense of the flow. I mean, who cares if a guy's foot is half an inch on the line? Is that worth going back 45 seconds and changing everything, with the unintended consequences? It's not my favorite rule, for sure.\"\n\nJames, however, defended the spirit of the replay rules.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you want to get it right,\" James said. \"So, it's unfortunate what happened. But you want to try to get it right, obviously. And our crew has a job to do -- which is the referees -- they have a job to do, and they have to do it at the best they can. So, all good.\"\n\nWith the score back to 124-117 after James' 3 was nullified, Wiggins won the jump ball, tipping it to Draymond Green, who tried to corral the ball near the baseline.\n\nWhile James was penalized for the heel of his sneaker supposedly touching the side out of bounds line, the Lakers believed that the toe of Green's shoe did the same on the baseline with 1:48 remaining. So Ham used another coach's challenge.\n\nAfter another review, the referees called it out of bounds on Green, and L.A. was granted possession back. The Lakers inbounded the ball, but the officials quickly blew their whistles, noticing the shot clock was not working properly. After the refs consulted with the scoreboard operators at center court, L.A. was given the ball to inbound again, and once again, the shot clock malfunctioned after the Lakers threw it in.\n\nThe false start happened four times in a row, eliciting louder and louder boos with each delay. The ABC broadcast even cut to actor and director Ben Affleck, seated courtside with Jennifer Lopez, slumping in his chair, unable to hide his impatience. The ABC cameras also caught James shaking his head and laughing at the extended break in the action as he said, \"I'm too old for this s---.\"\n\nEventually, Crypto.com Arena public address announcer Lawrence Tanter informed the crowd he would be counting down the shot clock over the arena speakers in order to resume play.\n\nAfter all that, L.A. got the ball in and James had the ball stripped by Warriors star Stephen Curry (31 points), leading to an alley-oop dunk for Jonathan Kuminga (23 points) and putting Golden State up 126-117 with 1:07 remaining.\n\n\"It was bizarre,\" Kerr said. \"It seems like a few times a year you get clock issues. That's about as extreme as I've been a part of where the backup unit doesn't work either. It's unfortunate. I felt bad for the fans. That was a great game, and then the last two minutes everyone is just kind of looking at each other wondering what to do.\"\n\nSeveral Lakers players pointed out that the shot clock had a hiccup during a Warriors possession with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, when it was counting down from 10 to 9, reset to 24 and play continued, with Trayce Jackson-Davis finishing the possession by scoring a driving hook shot with 10:38 to put Golden State up 104-96.\n\n\"Their points didn't get taken away because the clock malfunctioned,\" Ham said. \"They continued to play through. But it is what it is.\"\n\nThat sequence was also brought up in the postgame pool report.\n\n\"The shot clock malfunctioned during live play at that time, and that is not a reviewable matter,\" Guthrie said in a statement, adding it was the responsibility of the officiating crew to notice the discrepancy in the moment, and they failed to do so.\n\nL.A. came into the night with a one game lead on Golden State for No. 9 in the Western Conference standings. Saturday's result flipped both teams' positioning, with the Lakers now in 10th with 14 games remaining.\n\n\"It's going to take everything to scrape out some wins,\" Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell (23 points, 13 assists) said. \"At this time of the year, they all matter.\"",

        "title": "Musk's SpaceX is Building Spy Satellite Network for U.S. Intelligence Agency, Sources Say",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a U.S. intelligence agency, five sources familiar with the program said, demonstrating deepening ties between billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company and national security agencies.\n\nThe network is being built by SpaceX's Starshield business unit under a $1.8 billion contract signed in 2021 with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence agency that manages spy satellites, the sources said.\n\nThe plans show the extent of SpaceX's involvement in U.S. intelligence and military projects and illustrate a deeper Pentagon investment into vast, low-Earth orbiting satellite systems aimed at supporting ground forces.\n\nIf successful, the sources said the program would significantly advance the ability of the U.S. government and military to quickly spot potential targets almost anywhere on the globe.\n\nThe contract signals growing trust by the intelligence establishment of a company whose owner has clashed with the Biden administration and sparked controversy over the use of Starlink satellite connectivity in the Ukraine war, the sources said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February the existence of a $1.8 billion classified Starshield contract with an unknown intelligence agency without detailing the purposes of the program.\n\nReuters reporting discloses for the first time that the SpaceX contract is for a powerful new spy system with hundreds of satellites bearing Earth-imaging capabilities that can operate as a swarm in low orbits, and that the spy agency that Musk's company is working with is the NRO.\n\nReuters was unable to determine when the new network of satellites would come online and could not establish what other companies are part of the program with their own contracts.\n\nSpaceX, the world's largest satellite operator, did not respond to several requests for comment about the contract, its role in it and details on satellite launches. The Pentagon referred a request for comment to the NRO and SpaceX.\n\nIn a statement the NRO acknowledged its mission to develop a sophisticated satellite system and its partnerships with other government agencies, companies, research institutions and nations, but declined to comment on Reuters' findings about the extent of SpaceX's involvement in the effort.\n\n\"The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe satellites can track targets on the ground and share that data with U.S. intelligence and military officials, the sources said. In principle, that would enable the U.S. government to quickly capture continuous imagery of activities on the ground nearly anywhere on the globe, aiding intelligence and military operations, they added.\n\nRoughly a dozen prototypes have been launched since 2020, among other satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, three of the sources said.\n\nA U.S. government database of objects in orbit shows several SpaceX missions having deployed satellites that neither the company nor the government have ever acknowledged. Two sources confirmed those to be prototypes for the Starshield network.\n\nAll the sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. government program.\n\nThe Pentagon is already a big SpaceX customer, using its Falcon 9 rockets to launch military payloads into space. Starshield's first prototype satellite, launched in 2020, was part of a separate, roughly $200 million contract that helped position SpaceX for the subsequent $1.8 billion award, one of the sources said.\n\nThe planned Starshield network is separate from Starlink, SpaceX's growing commercial broadband constellation that has about 5,500 satellites in space to provide near-global internet to consumers, companies and government agencies.\n\nThe classified constellation of spy satellites represents one of the U.S. government's most sought-after capabilities in space because it is designed to offer the most persistent, pervasive and rapid coverage of activities on Earth.\n\n\"No one can hide,\" one of the sources said of the system's potential capability, when describing the network's reach.\n\nMusk, also the founder and CEO of Tesla TSLA.O and owner of social media company X, has driven innovation in space but has caused frustration among some officials in the Biden administration because of his past control of Starlink in Ukraine, where Kyiv's military uses it for secure communications in the conflict with Russia. That authority over Starlink in a war zone by Musk, and not the U.S. military, created tension between him and the US government.\n\nA series of Reuters' stories has detailed how Musk's manufacturing operations, including at SpaceX, have harmed consumers and workers.\n\nThe Starshield network is part of intensifying competition between the U.S. and its rivals to become the dominant military power in space, in part by expanding spy satellite systems away from bulky, expensive spacecraft at higher orbits. Instead a vast, low-orbiting network can provide quicker and near-constant imaging of the Earth.\n\nChina also plans to start building its own satellite constellations, and the Pentagon has warned of space weapon threats from Russia, which could be capable of disabling entire satellite networks.\n\nStarshield aims to be more resilient to attacks from sophisticated space powers.\n\nThe network is also intended to greatly expand the U.S. government's remote-sensing capabilities and will consist of large satellites with imaging sensors, as well as a greater number of relay satellites that pass the imaging data and other communications across the network using inter-satellite lasers, two of the sources said.\n\nThe NRO includes personnel from the U.S. Space Force and CIA and provides classified satellite imagery for the Pentagon and other intelligence agencies.\n\nThe spy satellites will house sensors provided by another company, three of the sources said.",

          "title": "Musk's SpaceX is building spy satellite network for U.S. intelligence agency, sources say",
          "body": "SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a U.S. intelligence agency, five sources familiar with the program said, demonstrating deepening ties between billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company and national security agencies.\n\nThe network is being built by SpaceX's Starshield business unit under a $1.8 billion contract signed in 2021 with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence agency that manages spy satellites, the sources said.\n\nThe plans show the extent of SpaceX's involvement in U.S. intelligence and military projects and illustrate a deeper Pentagon investment into vast, low-Earth orbiting satellite systems aimed at supporting ground forces.\n\nAlso Read |Starlink: Why the new sovereign of low-earth orbit is bad news\n\nIf successful, the sources said the program would significantly advance the ability of the U.S. government and military to quickly spot potential targets almost anywhere on the globe.\n\nThe contract signals growing trust by the intelligence establishment of a company whose owner has clashed with the Biden administration and sparked controversy over the use of Starlink satellite connectivity in the Ukraine war, the sources said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February the existence of a $1.8 billion classified Starshield contract with an unknown intelligence agency without detailing the purposes of the program.\n\nReuters reporting discloses for the first time that the SpaceX contract is for a powerful new spy system with hundreds of satellites bearing Earth-imaging capabilities that can operate as a swarm in low orbits, and that the spy agency that Mr. Musk's company is working with is the NRO.\n\nReuters was unable to determine when the new network of satellites would come online and could not establish what other companies are part of the program with their contracts.\n\nSpaceX, the world's largest satellite operator, did not respond to several requests for comment about the contract, its role in it and details on satellite launches. The Pentagon referred a request for comment to the NRO and SpaceX.\n\nIn a statement the NRO acknowledged its mission to develop a sophisticated satellite system and its partnerships with other government agencies, companies, research institutions and nations, but declined to comment on Reuters' findings about the extent of SpaceX's involvement in the effort.\n\n\"The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe satellites can track targets on the ground and share that data with U.S. intelligence and military officials, the sources said. In principle, that would enable the U.S. government to quickly capture continuous imagery of activities on the ground nearly anywhere on the globe, aiding intelligence and military operations, they added.\n\nRoughly a dozen prototypes have been launched since 2020, among other satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, three of the sources said.\n\nA U.S. government database of objects in orbit shows several SpaceX missions having deployed satellites that neither the company nor the government have ever acknowledged. Two sources confirmed those to be prototypes for the Starshield network.\n\nAll the sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. government program.\n\nThe Pentagon is already a big SpaceX customer, using its Falcon 9 rockets to launch military payloads into space. Starshield's first prototype satellite, launched in 2020, was part of a separate, roughly $200 million contract that helped position SpaceX for the subsequent $1.8 billion award, one of the sources said.\n\nThe planned Starshield network is separate from Starlink, SpaceX's growing commercial broadband constellation that has about 5,500 satellites in space to provide near-global internet to consumers, companies and government agencies.\n\nThe classified constellation of spy satellites represents one of the U.S. government's most sought-after capabilities in space because it is designed to offer the most persistent, pervasive and rapid coverage of activities on Earth.\n\n\"No one can hide,\" one of the sources said of the system's potential capability, when describing the network's reach.\n\nMr. Musk, also the founder and CEO of Tesla and owner of social media company X, has driven innovation in space but has caused frustration among some officials in the Biden administration because of his past control of Starlink in Ukraine, where Kyiv's military uses it for secure communications in the conflict with Russia. That authority over Starlink in a war zone by Mr. Musk, and not the U.S. military, created tension between him and the U.S. government.\n\nA series of Reuters' stories has detailed how Mr. Musk's manufacturing operations, including at SpaceX, have harmed consumers and workers.\n\nThe Starshield network is part of intensifying competition between the U.S. and its rivals to become the dominant military power in space, in part by expanding spy satellite systems away from bulky, expensive spacecraft at higher orbits. Instead a vast, low-orbiting network can provide quicker and near-constant imaging of the Earth.\n\nChina also plans to start building its own satellite constellations, and the Pentagon has warned of space weapon threats from Russia, which could be capable of disabling entire satellite networks.\n\nStarshield aims to be more resilient to attacks from sophisticated space powers.\n\nThe network is also intended to greatly expand the U.S. government's remote-sensing capabilities and will consist of large satellites with imaging sensors, as well as a greater number of relay satellites that pass the imaging data and other communications across the network using inter-satellite lasers, two of the sources said.\n\nThe NRO includes personnel from the U.S. Space Force and CIA and provides classified satellite imagery for the Pentagon and other intelligence agencies.\n\nThe spy satellites will house sensors provided by another company, three of the sources said.\n\nCopy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT",

        "body": "OAKLAND, Calif. (KRON) -- There was no shortage of excitement for rising K-pop girl group IVE's debut tour in the United States. Oakland is one of six U.S. cities the group performed in during its first world tour.\n\nIVE opened up the \"Show What I Have\" tour stop with thousands screaming and doing the K-pop-show tradition of waving light sticks to their hit single \"I AM.\"\n\nAfter a number of fast-paced songs to show off their dance moves, IVE slowed things down after an intermission with \"Shine With Me\" as all six were seated to sing the ballad. The group continued to show off their vocals with the ballad with \"Either Way.\"\n\nIn between songs, the group would talk to DIVE, the name of IVE's fanbase, via a translator. It was IVE's first time in Oakland, and members complimented on how nice the weather was in the East Bay city.\n\nIVE also performed \"After LIKE,\" remains the group's biggest hit to date. The music video is IVE's most-watched with more than 266 million YouTube views.\n\n\"I am so excited. Ahhh! They finally came (here) after two-and-half years,\" said 20-year-old concertgoer Tiffany Liebelt who made the trip from Manteca. She added that tickets were hard to get as it was a scramble online when they first dropped.\n\nIVE closed the nearly three-hour show with its newest single \"All Night\" -- a track that features Bay Area rapper Saweetie who did the 49ers' official playoff anthem.\n\nIt seems that Oakland Arena is the unofficial home for K-pop lovers in the Bay Area. IVE is another act from Korea to headline the venue.\n\nEight K-pop acts have headlined Oakland Arena since the genre's rise in the U.S. within the past decade, a venue spokesperson told KRON4.\n\nLast year, Oakland Arena hosted a number of sold-out shows. Fellow girl group TWICE sold the venue out twice (no pun intended) in June. Suga, a member of boy band sensation BTS, headlined a show in May.\n\nThanks to these K-pop acts selling out the venue, Oakland Arena/Coliseum had its best fiscal year ever.\n\nIU is set to perform at Oakland Arena on July 30 -- the penultimate stop of her world tour -- as the next K-pop act to headline the venue.",

        "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Isaiah Thomas has reportedly agreed to a 10-day contract with the Phoenix Suns after recently spending in time in the G League.\n\nThe Athletic first reported the news about the 35-year-old Thomas, who averaged 32.5 points in four games for the Salt Lake City Stars. The Suns (39-28) play the Milwaukee Bucks (43-24) on Sunday to end a four-game road trip.\n\nThomas played 46 games in one season with the Suns, 2014-15, averaging 15.2 points and 3.7 assists before being in a three-team deal to Boston where he was a two-time All-Star and made All-NBA.\n\nThe 5-9 Thomas averaged 17.7 points in 11 NBA seasons. He last played in the NBA in the 2021-22 with the Lakers, Mavericks and Hornets.\n\nThe Suns haven't had a true point guard all season, with the closest being Saben Lee, a two-way player. Thomas is more of a scoring point guard, but he could provide more secure ball handling for the Suns, 24th in the league in turnovers per game.\n\nThe Suns have one spot open on their 15-man standard roster.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

        "body": "Washington [US], Mar 17: US President Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson, James Singer, said in a statement that former President Donald Trump \"wants another January 6\" after Trump on Saturday said that there would be a 'bloodbath' in the country if he lost the upcoming polls, reported CNN.\n\nCondemning his statement, Singer emphasised that the US people would not make him win the presidential elections.\n\n\"American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge,\" Singer said.\n\nHis remark came as he promised a \"100% tariff\" on cars made outside the US, according to CNN.\n\nAddressing a rally near Ohio's Dayton, Trump said, \"We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected,\" Trump said in Vandalia, Ohio. \"Now, if I don't get elected...it's going to be a bloodbath for the country.\"\n\nIt was not clear what Trump exactly meant by his remarks, as the former US President was complaining about the automobile industry.\n\nAddressing the crowd, he said China will not be able to sell any vehicles imported to the US if he gets re-elected, Politico reported.\n\nTrump often showcases a dark image of the nation to present his case against US President Joe Biden ahead of the presidential elections that are likely to be held in November.\n\nHe frequently uses increasingly heightened rhetoric while speaking about the felony charges that he faces in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDuring his campaign events, Trump frequently brings up the events of January 6, as he still denounces the 2020 elections that he lost.\n\nAs he often does, the former US President opened the rally on Saturday with a recording of January 6 prisoners singing the national anthem, Politico reported.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden, in his speeches, continued to bring up the events of January 6, saying the result of the November election matters for the fate of democracy. The attack continues to remain a political danger for Republicans and Trump's campaign.",

          "body": "Washington, DC [US], March 17 (ANI): US President Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson, James Singer, said in a statement that former President Donald Trump \"wants another January 6\" after Trump on Saturday said that there would be a 'bloodbath' in the country if he lost the upcoming polls, reported CNN.\n\nCondemning his statement, Singer emphasised that the US people would not make him win the presidential elections.\n\n\"American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge,\" Singer said.\n\nHis remark came as he promised a \"100% tariff\" on cars made outside the US, according to CNN.\n\nAddressing a rally near Ohio's Dayton, Trump said, \"We're going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you're not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected,\" Trump said in Vandalia, Ohio. \"Now, if I don't get elected...it's going to be a bloodbath for the country.\"\n\nIt was not clear what Trump exactly meant by his remarks, as the former US President was complaining about the automobile industry.\n\nAddressing the crowd, he said China will not be able to sell any vehicles imported to the US if he gets re-elected, Politico reported.\n\nTrump often showcases a dark image of the nation to present his case against US President Joe Biden ahead of the presidential elections that are likely to be held in November.\n\nHe frequently uses increasingly heightened rhetoric while speaking about the felony charges that he faces in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDuring his campaign events, Trump frequently brings up the events of January 6, as he still denounces the 2020 elections that he lost.\n\nAs he often does, the former US President opened the rally on Saturday with a recording of January 6 prisoners singing the national anthem, Politico reported.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden, in his speeches, continued to bring up the events of January 6, saying the result of the November election matters for the fate of democracy. The attack continues to remain a political danger for Republicans and Trump's campaign. (ANI)",

        "title": "Broken clock, reviews mar end of Lakers-Warriors",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The last two minutes of the game clock in the Golden State Warriors' 128-121 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night took more than 20 minutes of real time to play out thanks to a series of replay reviews and shot-clock malfunctions.\n\nThe delays began with 1:50 remaining in the fourth, with the Lakers trailing 124-120, when L.A. coach Darvin Ham challenged an out of bounds call that granted the Warriors possession while Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and Golden State forward Andrew Wiggins both went for the rebound.\n\nWhile the officials were reviewing the out of bounds call, they determined that the corner 3-pointer LeBron James made on the previous trip down the court with 2:07 remaining did not count.\n\nThe Lakers ended up winning the challenge -- Hayes and Wiggins faced off for a jump ball -- but lost points in the process.\n\n\"I've never seen that be called before like that -- in that particular time,\" said James, who finished with 40 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds. \"That was kind of weird. ... It took some momentum away from us.\"\n\nThe ruling was eerily similar to one from a December game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, in which a late 3 by James that would have tied the score was downgraded to a 2-pointer after review. Just like he did that night, James disagreed with the call Saturday.\n\n\"I didn't believe I stepped on the line, obviously,\" James said Saturday. \"I knew how much space I had over there. And when I shoot, I shoot on my tippy toes, so it's kind of hard for me to have a heel down.\"\n\nCrew chief David Guthrie explained the ruling in a postgame statement to a pool reporter.\n\n\"James' left foot is out of bounds as he begins to shoot,\" Guthrie said. \"Yes, it is reviewable at that time. The rule is Rule 13, Section II(f)(3): Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation, the replay center official will only look at the position of the player's feet at the moment they touch the floor immediately prior to the release of the shot. This can be applied during other replay triggers as well.\"\n\nWhile the overturned 3 helped his team, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he would just as soon lived without it.\n\n\"I also don't like the rule that you can go back and look at an out of bounds, or LeBron's 3,\" Kerr said. \"That seems to happen once or twice a year. I'd love to see that rule go away. I think we're trying so hard to get everything just right, at the expense of the flow. I mean, who cares if a guy's foot is half an inch on the line? Is that worth going back 45 seconds and changing everything, with the unintended consequences? It's not my favorite rule, for sure.\"\n\nJames, however, defended the spirit of the replay rules.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you want to get it right,\" James said. \"So, it's unfortunate what happened. But you want to try to get it right, obviously. And our crew has a job to do -- which is the referees -- they have a job to do, and they have to do it at the best they can. So, all good.\"\n\nWith the score back to 124-117 after James' 3 was nullified, Wiggins won the jump ball, tipping it to Draymond Green, who tried to corral the ball near the baseline.\n\nWhile James was penalized for the heel of his sneaker supposedly touching the side out of bounds line, the Lakers believed that the toe of Green's shoe did the same on the baseline with 1:48 remaining. So Ham used another coach's challenge.\n\nAfter another review, the referees called it out of bounds on Green, and L.A. was granted possession back. The Lakers inbounded the ball, but the officials quickly blew their whistles, noticing the shot clock was not working properly. After the refs consulted with the scoreboard operators at center court, L.A. was given the ball to inbound again, and once again, the shot clock malfunctioned after the Lakers threw it in.\n\nThe false start happened four times in a row, eliciting louder and louder boos with each delay. The ABC broadcast even cut to actor and director Ben Affleck, seated courtside with Jennifer Lopez, slumping in his chair, unable to hide his impatience. The ABC cameras also caught James shaking his head and laughing at the extended break in the action as he said, \"I'm too old for this s---.\"\n\nEventually, Crypto.com Arena public address announcer Lawrence Tanter informed the crowd he would be counting down the shot clock over the arena speakers in order to resume play.\n\nAfter all that, L.A. got the ball in and James had the ball stripped by Warriors star Stephen Curry (31 points), leading to an alley-oop dunk for Jonathan Kuminga (23 points) and putting Golden State up 126-117 with 1:07 remaining.\n\n\"It was bizarre,\" Kerr said. \"It seems like a few times a year you get clock issues. That's about as extreme as I've been a part of where the backup unit doesn't work either. It's unfortunate. I felt bad for the fans. That was a great game, and then the last two minutes everyone is just kind of looking at each other wondering what to do.\"\n\nSeveral Lakers players pointed out that the shot clock had a hiccup during a Warriors possession with 10:53 remaining in the fourth quarter, when it was counting down from 10 to 9, reset to 24 and play continued, with Trayce Jackson-Davis finishing the possession by scoring a driving hook shot with 10:38 to put Golden State up 104-96.\n\n\"Their points didn't get taken away because the clock malfunctioned,\" Ham said. \"They continued to play through. But it is what it is.\"\n\nThat sequence was also brought up in the postgame pool report.\n\n\"The shot clock malfunctioned during live play at that time, and that is not a reviewable matter,\" Guthrie said in a statement, adding it was the responsibility of the officiating crew to notice the discrepancy in the moment, and they failed to do so.\n\nL.A. came into the night with a one game lead on Golden State for No. 9 in the Western Conference standings. Saturday's result flipped both teams' positioning, with the Lakers now in 10th with 14 games remaining.\n\n\"It's going to take everything to scrape out some wins,\" Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell (23 points, 13 assists) said. \"At this time of the year, they all matter.\"",

        "body": "KNOB NOSTER -- The Russellville Indians opened the baseball season Saturday by going 1-1 in a pair of games.\n\nRussellville opened with an 8-5 win in nine innings against Lafayette County, then fell 7-6 in eight innings to Knob Noster.\n\nLafayette County led 3-1 after three innings before Russellville scored four times in the top of the fourth. Lafayette County got one of those runs back in bottom of the fourth, then tied it at 5 with a run in the sixth.\n\nRussellville got the win with a three-run ninth inning.\n\nJustin Seaver got the win, pitching the final 3⅓ innings. He allowed one hit and two walks while striking out eight.\n\nSeaver also had four hits to lead a 10-hit Russellville attack. Only three of Russellville's runs were earned as Lafayette County had five errors in the game.\n\nThe second game was settled with a wild final two innings.\n\nRussellville scored a run in the second inning and that lead held up going to the seventh.\n\nRussellville scored three runs to make it 4-0 in the top of the seventh before Knob Noster tied it with a four-run bottom of the inning. Russellville regained the lead with two runs in the top of the eighth before Knob Noster won it with three runs in the bottom of the inning.\n\nJackie Lake pitched the first six-plus innings for Russellville, allowing three runs on six hits and no walks with six strikeouts. Tate Jennewein got two outs in relief, allowing a run on three walks. Ethan Hickey took the loss, allowing three runs (one earned) on three hits and a walk while striking out one.\n\nRussellville is back in action Monday for its home opener against Eldon (2-1).",

        "title": "Bears trade Fields to Steelers",
        "body": "CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night, clearing the way for them to draft a quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick -- perhaps USC's Caleb Williams.\n\nThe Bears received a 2025 sixth-round draft pick that could potentially become a fourth-rounder this year in return.\n\n\"We have engaged in multiple trade conversations in recent weeks and believe trading Justin at this time to Pittsburgh is what is best for both Justin and the Bears,\" general manager Ryan Poles said in a statement. \"Today we spoke to Justin to inform him of the trade and the rationale behind it for us as a club.\n\n\"We want to thank him for his tireless dedication, leadership and all he poured into our franchise and community the last three years and wish him the best towards a long and successful NFL career.\"\n\nFields thanked Chicago and the organization, as well as his teammates in a post on X.\n\n\"Can't say thank you enough to the city of Chicago for taking me in and embracing me,\" he tweeted. \"Thank you to the entire Bears organization and ownership for allowing me the opportunity to be part of such a historic franchise. But most of all thank you to my all my brothers that I played with. You all were the reason I attacked each day the way I did. I can't thank you all enough for what y'all have meant to me over the last 3 years through the ups and downs. I wish each one of you nothing but success.\n\n\"Ready for this next chapter!\"\n\nFields figures to back up nine-time Pro Bowler Russell Wilson, who signed a one-year deal with the Steelers on Friday. Pittsburgh also traded Kenny Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles once it added Wilson.\n\nWilson tweeted a picture of him and Fields shaking hands with the message: \"Let's get it justnfields! QB room bout to be (fire).\"\n\nFields, drafted 11th overall in 2021 by the Bears and former general manager Ryan Pace, struggled as a rookie under former coach Matt Nagy. Though he produced big plays with his legs and arm, he did not develop as a passer the way the team hoped the past two years under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.\n\nFields completed 578-of-958 passes for 6,674 yards with 40 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in three seasons. He has just one 300-yard passing game in his career.\n\nChicago could have gotten a big haul by trading the No. 1 pick. But it's not often the historically quarterback-challenged Bears have a chance to draft a prospect such as Williams. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is largely expected to be picked first overall after he threw 72 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions the past two seasons at USC after a year at Oklahoma.\n\nThe trade of Fields comes two days after the Bears acquired Keenan Allen from the Los Angeles Chargers in their second deal for a star receiver in as many years.\n\nThey dealt the No. 1 pick in 2023 to Carolina for DJ Moore last March. The Bears also got the Panthers' first-rounder this year. And with Carolina finishing a league-worst 2-15 record, Chicago wound up with the No. 1 pick this year.\n\nFields, meanwhile, gets a chance at a fresh start in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers totally revamped their quarterback room during the last month, with Pickett, Mitch Trubisky (cut) and Mason Rudolph (signed with Tennessee) gone.\n\nTeam president Art Rooney II made it very clear in January it was \"time to get some wins\" in the postseason. While the team publicly backed Pickett in the aftermath of a year that ended with the former first-round pick serving as Rudolph's backup, in a way the Steelers had no choice at the time with Trubisky all but assured of being a salary cap casualty and Rudolph set to become a free agent.\n\nThings have changed rapidly, an uncharacteristic development for a team that prides itself on stability in a league built on the opposite in most places.\n\nThere is little doubt Wilson will be the starter in Week 1, allowing Fields time to get familiar with first-year offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's system and hit the reset button on a career that hasn't gone to plan.\n\nWhile Fields has had accuracy issues, he also offers the kind of mobility that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has craved for years. Tomlin hoped Pickett would be able to offer a portion of it. Instead, Pickett struggled to make significant strides during his first full season as a starter in 2023. He threw for just six touchdowns and four interceptions in 12 games, the kind of production that sent Pittsburgh into the offseason with more questions than answers about the most important position on the field.\n\nFour days into the new league year, those questions are very different.\n\nCan Wilson regain the winning touch he had during his highly successful run in Seattle? And can Fields develop into the kind of player Chicago envisioned when it took him with the 11th overall pick in 2021?",

          "title": "Bears trade Justin Fields to Steelers, clear way to take a QB such as Caleb Williams with No. 1 pick",
          "body": "Chicago -- The Chicago Bears traded Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Saturday night, clearing the way for them to draft a quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick -- perhaps USC's Caleb Williams.\n\nThe Bears received a 2025 sixth-round draft pick that could potentially become a fourth-rounder this year in return.\n\n\"We have engaged in multiple trade conversations in recent weeks and believe trading Justin at this time to Pittsburgh is what is best for both Justin and the Bears,\" general manager Ryan Poles said in a statement. \"Today we spoke to Justin to inform him of the trade and the rationale behind it for us as a club.\n\n\"We want to thank him for his tireless dedication, leadership and all he poured into our franchise and community the last three years and wish him the best towards a long and successful NFL career.\"\n\nFields thanked Chicago and the organization, as well as his teammates in a post on X.\n\n\"Can't say thank you enough to the city of Chicago for taking me in and embracing me,\" he tweeted. \"Thank you to the entire Bears organization and ownership for allowing me the opportunity to be part of such a historic franchise. But most of all thank you to my all my brothers that I played with. You all were the reason I attacked each day the way I did. I can't thank you all enough for what y'all have meant to me over the last 3 years through the ups and downs. I wish each one of you nothing but success.\n\n\"Ready for this next chapter!\"\n\nFields figures to back up nine-time Pro Bowler Russell Wilson, who signed a one-year deal with the Steelers on Friday. Pittsburgh also traded Kenny Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles once it added Wilson.\n\nWilson tweeted a picture of him and Fields shaking hands with the message: \"Let's get it @justnfields! QB room bout to be (fire).\"\n\nFields, drafted 11th overall in 2021 by the Bears and former general manager Ryan Pace, struggled as a rookie under former coach Matt Nagy. Though he produced big plays with his legs and arms, he did not develop as a passer the way the team hoped the past two years under Poles and coach Matt Eberflus.\n\nFields completed 578 of 958 passes for 6,674 yards with 40 touchdowns and 30 interceptions in three seasons. He has just one 300-yard passing game in his career.\n\nChicago could have gotten a big haul by trading the No. 1 pick. But it's not often the historically quarterback-challenged Bears have a chance to draft a prospect such as Williams. The 2022 Heisman Trophy winner is largely expected to be picked first overall after he threw 72 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions the past two seasons at USC after a year at Oklahoma.\n\nThe trade of Fields comes two days after the Bears acquired Keenan Allen from the Los Angeles Chargers in their second deal for a star receiver in as many years.\n\nThey dealt the No. 1 pick in 2023 to Carolina for DJ Moore last March. The Bears also got the Panthers' first-rounder this year. And with Carolina finishing a league-worst 2-15 record, Chicago wound up with the No. 1 pick this year.\n\nFields, meanwhile, gets a chance at a fresh start in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers totally revamped their quarterback room over the last month, with Pickett, Mitch Trubisky (cut) and Mason Rudolph (signed with Tennessee) gone.\n\nPresident Art Rooney II made it very clear in January that it was \"time to get some wins\" in the postseason. While the team publicly backed Pickett in the aftermath of a year that ended with the former first-round pick serving as Rudolph's backup, in a way the Steelers had no choice at the time with Trubisky all but assured of being a salary cap casualty and Rudolph set to become a free agent.\n\nThings have changed rapidly, an uncharacteristic development for a team that prides itself on stability in a league built on the opposite in most places.\n\nThere is little doubt Wilson will be the starter in Week 1, allowing Fields time to get familiar with first-year offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's system and hit the reset button on a career that hasn't gone to plan.\n\nWhile Fields has had accuracy issues, he also offers the kind of mobility that Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has craved for years. Tomlin hoped Pickett would be able to offer a portion of it. Instead, Pickett struggled to make significant strides during his first full season as a starter in 2023. He threw for just six touchdowns and four interceptions in 12 games, the kind of production that sent Pittsburgh into the offseason with more questions than answers about the most important position on the field.\n\nFour days into the new league year, those questions are very different.\n\nCan Wilson regain the winning touch he had during his highly successful run in Seattle? And can Fields develop into the kind of player Chicago envisioned when it took him with the 11th overall pick in 2021?\n\n___",

        "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

(AP) -- Alex Ovechkin scored his 841st career goal and Washington beat Vancouver.\n\nTom Wilson also scored as the Capitals pulled into a tie with the New York Islanders, one point behind Detroit for the second wild-card berth in the Eastern Conference. Charlie Lindgren finished with 21 saves.\n\nOvechkin pulled 53 goals behind Wayne Gretzky for first place on the NHL's career scoring list.\n\nBrock Boeser scored for the Canucks, who remained atop the Western Conference, one point ahead of Central Division-leading Colorado and Dallas. Casey DeSmith had 22 saves.\n\nVancouver pulled DeSmith with two minutes left but couldn't beat Lindgren with the extra skater.\n\nVancouver got on the board just 1:11 into the game when Quinn Hughes fired a shot from the faceoff circle and Boeser tipped it in through Lindgren's legs for his team-leading 36th goal of the season.\n\nWith an assist on the play, Hughes got his 77th point of the campaign, setting a new career high. The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\n---\n\nPREDATORS 4 KRAKEN 1\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\n---\n\nAVALANCHE 3 OILERS 2 (OT)\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win. Jordan Binnington made 22 stops in regulation and OT.\n\nThe Blues and Wild are fighting for playoff positioning in the Western Conference, looking to chase down Vegas for the final wild card. The Golden Knights play Sunday afternoon against New Jersey.\n\nKirill Kaprizov had a goal and an assist for Minnesota, which had won five of six. Marco Rossi also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves through overtime.\n\n---\n\nRED WINGS 4 SABRES 1\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Patrick Kane scored a tiebreaking goal late in the second period and James Reimer stopped 25 shots, lifting Detroit over Buffalo in a matchup of teams vying for a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nDetroit earned a desperately needed win after losing seven straight games in regulation for the first time since early in the 2019-20 season. The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\n---\n\nFLAMES 5 CANADIENS 2\n\nCALGARY, Alta.

Markstrom is day to day.\n\nFlames defenceman Mackenzie Weegar had three assists, and winger Jonathan Huberdeau finished with two.\n\nDavid Savard and Cole Caufield scored for Montreal. Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\n---\n\nSTARS 4 KINGS 1\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\n---\n\nBLUE JACKETS 4 SHARKS 2\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\n---\n\nCOYOTES 4 DEVILS 1\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping.

John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina.

(AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win.

The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\n---\n\nFLAMES 5 CANADIENS 2\n\nCALGARY, Alta.

Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\n---\n\nSTARS 4 KINGS 1\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\n---\n\nBLUE JACKETS 4 SHARKS 2\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\n---\n\nCOYOTES 4 DEVILS 1\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping.

His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers.

Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles.

          "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

Casey DeSmith had 22 saves.\n\nVancouver pulled DeSmith with two minutes left but couldn't beat Lindgren with the extra skater.\n\nVancouver got on the board just 1:11 into the game when Quinn Hughes fired a shot from the faceoff circle and Boeser tipped it in through Lindgren's legs for his team-leading 36th goal of the season.\n\nWith an assist on the play, Hughes got his 77th point of the campaign, setting a new career high. The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\n---\n\nPREDATORS 4 KRAKEN 1\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\n---\n\nAVALANCHE 3 OILERS 2 (OT)\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win.

The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\n---\n\nFLAMES 5 CANADIENS 2\n\nCALGARY, Alta.

Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\n---\n\nSTARS 4 KINGS 1\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\n---\n\nBLUE JACKETS 4 SHARKS 2\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\n---\n\nCOYOTES 4 DEVILS 1\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by entertainers and writers of color.\n\nAfter Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, the superstar R&B singer spoke about being thankful about the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.\n\nHe reeled off several of his recent big moments including his sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth studio album \"Coming Home\" and his Super Bowl halftime performance, which became the most-watched in the game's history.\n\nUsher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and Keke Palmer.\n\n\"I don't know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,\" said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey's presence, he thanked those who have supported him throughout the years.\n\n\"This is for you, you, my number ones,\" the singer said as the audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech were recited lyrics from his popular song \"Superstar\" from his 2024 album \"Confessions,\" which has sold more than 10 million units in the U.S.\n\nEarlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President's Award for the singer's public service achievements through his New Look Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl halftime performance last month.\n\n\"The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger woman,\" he said.\n\nBarrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a motion picture.\n\n\"I didn't prepare a speech, because I didn't think I was going to win,\" the singer-actor said. \"I was afraid to play Celie, but I'm glad I did. Because I kept saying 'If I don't win an award, the awards that I will win will come from the people who watched 'Color Purple' and the women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk out.'\"\n\nNew Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.\n\n\"We stand here in brotherhood,\" said Michael Bivins while his group members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.\n\n\"You've seen our story. You know what we've been through,\" said Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.\n\n\"But we call each other every day,\" he continued. \"We text each other every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We're still growing.\"\n\nDamson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role in \"Snowfall.\" Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in \"The Color Purple.\" Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for his role in \"Rustin.\"",

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by entertainers and writers of color.\n\nAfter Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, the superstar R&B singer spoke about being thankful about the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.\n\nHe reeled off several of his recent big moments including his sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth studio album \"Coming Home\" and his Super Bowl halftime performance, which became the most-watched in the game's history.\n\nUsher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and Keke Palmer.\n\n\"I don't know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,\" said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey's presence, he thanked those who have supported him throughout the years.\n\n\"This is for you, you, my number ones,\" the singer said as the audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech were recited lyrics from his popular song \"Superstar\" from his 2024 album \"Confessions,\" which has sold more than 10 million units in the U.S.\n\nEarlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President's Award for the singer's public service achievements through his New Look Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl halftime performance last month.\n\n\"The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger woman,\" he said.\n\nBarrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a motion picture.\n\n\"I didn't prepare a speech, because I didn't think I was going to win,\" the singer-actor said. \"I was afraid to play Celie, but I'm glad I did. Because I kept saying 'If I don't win an award, the awards that I will win will come from the people who watched 'Color Purple' and the women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk out.'\"\n\nNew Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.\n\n\"We stand here in brotherhood,\" said Michael Bivins while his group members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.\n\n\"You've seen our story. You know what we've been through,\" said Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.\n\n\"But we call each other every day,\" he continued. \"We text each other every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We're still growing.\"\n\nDamson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role in \"Snowfall.\" Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in \"The Color Purple.\" Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for his role in \"Rustin.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

Casey DeSmith had 22 saves.\n\nVancouver pulled DeSmith with two minutes left but couldn't beat Lindgren with the extra skater.\n\nVancouver got on the board just 1:11 into the game when Quinn Hughes fired a shot from the faceoff circle and Boeser tipped it in through Lindgren's legs for his team-leading 36th goal of the season.\n\nWith an assist on the play, Hughes got his 77th point of the campaign, setting a new career high. The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\n---\n\nPREDATORS 4 KRAKEN 1\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\n---\n\nAVALANCHE 3 OILERS 2 (OT)\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win.

The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\n---\n\nFLAMES 5 CANADIENS 2\n\nCALGARY, Alta.

          "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Steven Stamkos scored two goals, Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 47 shots and Tampa Bay beat Florida.\n\nDarren Raddysh, Michael Eyssimont and Nikita Kucherov also scored for the Lightning, who have won four of five. Vasilevskiy had 16 saves in the second period when Tampa Bay was outshot 18-3.\n\nThe Lightning are four points ahead of the Detroit Red Wings for the top wild card in the Eastern Conference.\n\nSam Reinhart had two goals and Matthew Tkachuk had a goal and an assist as Florida lost its second straight after winning eight of nine.

        "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\n---\n\nLIGHTNING 5 PANTHERS 3\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\n---\n\nPREDATORS 4 KRAKEN 1\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\n---\n\nAVALANCHE 3 OILERS 2 (OT)\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win.

The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\n---\n\nFLAMES 5 CANADIENS 2\n\nCALGARY, Alta.

Markstrom is day to day.\n\nFlames defenceman Mackenzie Weegar had three assists, and winger Jonathan Huberdeau finished with two.\n\nDavid Savard and Cole Caufield scored for Montreal. Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\n---\n\nSTARS 4 KINGS 1\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\n---\n\nBLUE JACKETS 4 SHARKS 2\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\n---\n\nCOYOTES 4 DEVILS 1\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping.

John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers.

Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina.

        "title": "Fort Smith Public Schools' police chief, former sheriff Bill Hollenbeck announces retirement",
        "body": "FORT SMITH -- School District Police Chief Bill Hollenbeck has announced his plans to retire at the end of this school year after nearly six years with the district.\n\nHollenbeck previously worked 27 years at the Sebastian County Sheriff's Office, including eight years as sheriff, before he was asked to work at Fort Smith Public Schools as the director of facilities and security.\n\nHe said that position changed to police chief shortly thereafter, with the Governor's Safe School Commission recommendation allowing schools to start police departments, just like colleges and universities. A bill on the matter was signed into law in April 2019, and the Fort Smith School District Police Department started three months later.\n\nHollenbeck said roughly eight other school agencies started around that time, which has now increased to about 15 agencies across the state.\n\n\"The primary mission is protecting our future,\" he said. \"That's our motto. To protect our students and our staff. We have school resource officers at the middle schools and the high schools, and then we have patrol officers that patrol our elementary schools. So it's kind of a trifecta role of protecting our students and our staff, also mentoring our students and educating them in certain areas, from the dangers of alcohol, drug use, things of that nature.\"\n\nHollenbeck said some of the highlights during his tenure in the district include being appointed by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson to the Arkansas Safe Schools Commission, helping create the district's Police Department to protect students and being part of the successful 2018 millage campaign, when voters approved a 5.56-mill property tax increase that helped fund safety measures, including controlled access into district buildings.\n\nHollenbeck said the department currently has 17 officers, a dispatch center and a social worker.\n\n\"It's been a great honor to lead this department. The amazing thing is not me, but it's the men and women that work for the school Police Department. Every single day they go to work to protect all these children. They're specially trained. They have specialize training in medical and dealing with active shooters, suicide prevention, behavioral health. All these things that they do behind the scenes every day, with at times very little thanks, but they're there, standing watch, protecting thousands and thousands of students.\" he said.\n\nHollenbeck said he'll finish the school year and plans to take the summer off before considering a couple of job offers he's received.\n\nLt. Eric Huber is the second in command at the department.\n\nHuber said he started his career dispatching for the Paris Police Department for 11 years. He's worked in the School District for 20 years, previously as a school resource officer.\n\n\"He is primed and ready to go, so whatever the decision is, he is very, very well suited to sit in the [chief's] chair, for sure,\" Hollenbeck said. \"That will be up to the superintendent as to who they hire next. But he's certainly capable of this position and very, very well trained.\"\n\n\"Really enjoy what I'm doing and grateful for the experience that we have here at Fort Smith Public Schools,\" Huber said. \"What Dr. Morawski has accomplished with our Police Department and what he has done since he's been here, as well. Chief Hollenbeck has been a wonderful chief. He's been a great mentor. He's started a wonderful department here, and we hope to continue on his success.\"\n\nThe School Board recognized Hollenbeck's retirement during its monthly meeting Monday.\n\n\"Thank you for your service and your time here with our district,\" board member Phil Whiteaker said.\n\nLt. Eric Huber of the Fort Smith Public Schools Police Department speaks Wednesday at the Rogers Center in Fort Smith. Huber will be a potential candidate for the department's chief position following the retirement of Chief Bill Hollenbeck at the end of June.

        "body": "FORT SMITH -- School District Superintendent Terry Morawski received national superintendent certification from the American Association of School Administrators last month, according to a district news release.\n\nMorawski is among 30 superintendents nationwide who completed the certification program this year, the release states.\n\n\"This professional learning opportunity has been one of the most valuable experiences in my educational journey,\" Morawski said. \"In light of the increasing challenges impacting our students and community, this opportunity to learn and share with some of the brightest education minds in the country has been extremely valuable.\"\n\nThe certification process spanned 20 months and is designed for superintendents with up to seven years of experience or those looking to update their skills. The program includes forums, seminars, and coaching to address real-life challenges, covering instructional leadership, budget management, communication, leveraging technology in education and administration, and other topics, according to the release.\n\nMorawski joined the School District in 2017 as its chief operations officer. He later became deputy superintendent before being promoted to superintendent in January 2021.",

        "title": "Fort Smith Public Schools' police chief, former sheriff Bill Hollenbeck announces retirement",
        "body": "FORT SMITH -- School District Police Chief Bill Hollenbeck has announced his plans to retire at the end of this school year after nearly six years with the district.\n\nHollenbeck previously worked 27 years at the Sebastian County Sheriff's Office, including eight years as sheriff, before he was asked to work at Fort Smith Public Schools as the director of facilities and security.\n\nHe said that position changed to police chief shortly thereafter, with the Governor's Safe School Commission recommendation allowing schools to start police departments, just like colleges and universities. A bill on the matter was signed into law in April 2019, and the Fort Smith School District Police Department started three months later.\n\nHollenbeck said roughly eight other school agencies started around that time, which has now increased to about 15 agencies across the state.\n\n\"The primary mission is protecting our future,\" he said. \"That's our motto. To protect our students and our staff. We have school resource officers at the middle schools and the high schools, and then we have patrol officers that patrol our elementary schools. So it's kind of a trifecta role of protecting our students and our staff, also mentoring our students and educating them in certain areas, from the dangers of alcohol, drug use, things of that nature.\"\n\nHollenbeck said some of the highlights during his tenure in the district include being appointed by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson to the Arkansas Safe Schools Commission, helping create the district's Police Department to protect students and being part of the successful 2018 millage campaign, when voters approved a 5.56-mill property tax increase that helped fund safety measures, including controlled access into district buildings.\n\nHollenbeck said the department currently has 17 officers, a dispatch center and a social worker.\n\n\"It's been a great honor to lead this department. The amazing thing is not me, but it's the men and women that work for the school Police Department. Every single day they go to work to protect all these children. They're specially trained. They have specialize training in medical and dealing with active shooters, suicide prevention, behavioral health. All these things that they do behind the scenes every day, with at times very little thanks, but they're there, standing watch, protecting thousands and thousands of students.\" he said.\n\nHollenbeck said he'll finish the school year and plans to take the summer off before considering a couple of job offers he's received.\n\nLt. Eric Huber is the second in command at the department.\n\nHuber said he started his career dispatching for the Paris Police Department for 11 years. He's worked in the School District for 20 years, previously as a school resource officer.\n\n\"He is primed and ready to go, so whatever the decision is, he is very, very well suited to sit in the [chief's] chair, for sure,\" Hollenbeck said. \"That will be up to the superintendent as to who they hire next. But he's certainly capable of this position and very, very well trained.\"\n\n\"Really enjoy what I'm doing and grateful for the experience that we have here at Fort Smith Public Schools,\" Huber said. \"What Dr. Morawski has accomplished with our Police Department and what he has done since he's been here, as well. Chief Hollenbeck has been a wonderful chief. He's been a great mentor. He's started a wonderful department here, and we hope to continue on his success.\"\n\nThe School Board recognized Hollenbeck's retirement during its monthly meeting Monday.\n\n\"Thank you for your service and your time here with our district,\" board member Phil Whiteaker said.\n\nLt. Eric Huber of the Fort Smith Public Schools Police Department speaks Wednesday at the Rogers Center in Fort Smith. Huber will be a potential candidate for the department's chief position following the retirement of Chief Bill Hollenbeck at the end of June.

          "title": "Fort Smith Public Schools' police chief, former sheriff Bill Hollenbeck announces retirement",
          "body": "FORT SMITH -- School District Police Chief Bill Hollenbeck has announced his plans to retire at the end of this school year after nearly six years with the district.\n\nHollenbeck previously worked 27 years at the Sebastian County Sheriff's Office, including eight years as sheriff, before he was asked to work at Fort Smith Public Schools as the director of facilities and security.\n\nHe said that position changed to police chief shortly thereafter, with the Governor's Safe School Commission recommendation allowing schools to start police departments, just like colleges and universities. A bill on the matter was signed into law in April 2019, and the Fort Smith School District Police Department started three months later.\n\nHollenbeck said roughly eight other school agencies started around that time, which has now increased to about 15 agencies across the state.\n\n\"The primary mission is protecting our future,\" he said. \"That's our motto. To protect our students and our staff. We have school resource officers at the middle schools and the high schools, and then we have patrol officers that patrol our elementary schools. So it's kind of a trifecta role of protecting our students and our staff, also mentoring our students and educating them in certain areas, from the dangers of alcohol, drug use, things of that nature.\"\n\nHollenbeck said some of the highlights during his tenure in the district include being appointed by former Gov. Asa Hutchinson to the Arkansas Safe Schools Commission, helping create the district's Police Department to protect students and being part of the successful 2018 millage campaign, when voters approved a 5.56-mill property tax increase that helped fund safety measures, including controlled access into district buildings.\n\nHollenbeck said the department currently has 17 officers, a dispatch center and a social worker.\n\n\"It's been a great honor to lead this department. The amazing thing is not me, but it's the men and women that work for the school Police Department. Every single day they go to work to protect all these children. They're specially trained. They have specialize training in medical and dealing with active shooters, suicide prevention, behavioral health. All these things that they do behind the scenes every day, with at times very little thanks, but they're there, standing watch, protecting thousands and thousands of students.\" he said.\n\nHollenbeck said he'll finish the school year and plans to take the summer off before considering a couple of job offers he's received.\n\nLt. Eric Huber is the second in command at the department.\n\nHuber said he started his career dispatching for the Paris Police Department for 11 years. He's worked in the School District for 20 years, previously as a school resource officer.\n\n\"He is primed and ready to go, so whatever the decision is, he is very, very well suited to sit in the [chief's] chair, for sure,\" Hollenbeck said. \"That will be up to the superintendent as to who they hire next. But he's certainly capable of this position and very, very well trained.\"\n\n\"Really enjoy what I'm doing and grateful for the experience that we have here at Fort Smith Public Schools,\" Huber said. \"What Dr. Morawski has accomplished with our Police Department and what he has done since he's been here, as well. Chief Hollenbeck has been a wonderful chief. He's been a great mentor. He's started a wonderful department here, and we hope to continue on his success.\"\n\nThe School Board recognized Hollenbeck's retirement during its monthly meeting Monday.\n\n\"Thank you for your service and your time here with our district,\" board member Phil Whiteaker said.\n\nLt. Eric Huber of the Fort Smith Public Schools Police Department speaks Wednesday at the Rogers Center in Fort Smith. Huber will be a potential candidate for the department's chief position following the retirement of Chief Bill Hollenbeck at the end of June.

        "body": "FORT SMITH -- A River Valley octogenarian can now boast of having earned one of the most coveted prizes among marathon runners.\n\nMary Jo Brinkman, 82, of Fort Smith ran the Tokyo Marathon on March 2. It was the latest of six World Marathon Majors she has finished, an achievement that qualified her for the Six Star Medal.\n\nThe World Marathon Majors include six high-profile international marathons. Abbott World Marathon Majors sponsors the competitions and keeps track of runners who finish the series. Those who complete all six earn the Six Star Medal and a spot in the Hall of Fame on Abbott's website.\n\nBrinkman, a Nebraska native, moved to Fort Smith 32 years ago and made the River Valley her home. She began her running career in 2005 when her biking exercise class decided to run a few laps. While she had been passionate about fitness and exercise her whole life, running was new to her.\n\n\"The first time around the track I could barely even make it -- I thought I was going to have a heart attack,\" Brinkman said.\n\nBut she persisted in her training, and in 2006 she went to San Diego to run a marathon raising funds for leukemia and lymphoma after a friend invited her. Others warned her this might be too soon to run a marathon, and they were right. At mile 18, she stopped running and walked the rest of the way.\n\nBut Brinkman began training harder and set out on another marathon.\n\n\"I trained really hard and ran the Dallas marathon in 2006, and I qualified for the Boston Marathon, and that's how I got started,\" Brinkman said.\n\n\"She's a matriarch in our running community. Everybody knows Mary Jo,\" said fellow runner and friend Alison Gleason, a Fort Smith resident of 35 years. \"If you haven't met her, you've heard of her.\"\n\nBrinkman finished the Boston Marathon in 2007 and unknowingly earned her first star. Next she ran the New York Marathon, earning her second.\n\nHowever, life got in the way not long after. Brinkman began her battle with sciatica -- chronic pain after an injury to the sciatic nerve in the back. But she trained hard, began doing yoga and just kept running.\n\nTo date, Brinkman has completed 32 marathons, and said her favorite is the Boston Marathon. She has run that race five times -- including the infamous 2013 race.\n\nBrinkman was only half a mile from the finish line when the bombs went off, killing three people and wounding hundreds more.\n\n\"They said to me 'stop, stop , stop!' and I said 'I'm not gonna stop, I've only got half a mile to go,'\" Brinkman said. \"And I thought, why are all these people looking back at us. Then a patrolman got in front of me and said, 'Ma'am you have to stop, there's been deaths at the finish line.\"\n\nShe quickly ran to the bus and grabbed her bag to call her son. Not a moment after she did, officials told runners to drop their bags, as they might have bombs and run -- don't walk -- somewhere safe. Brinkman's hotel, with her travel companion still there, were on the route the bombers had taken and surrounded by police -- no one in and no one out.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, Brinkman was able to take stock of what had just happened.\n\n\"I could have been at the finish line. I had taken my shoe off during the race, and it probably took about that much time that kept me from being at the finish line,\" Brinkman said. \"My foot hurt, and I usually don't stop for anything, but my foot hurt, and I couldn't run. So I stopped to fix it, and that kept me from being at the finish line when the bombs went off.\"\n\nThe very next year she was back in Boston, running, and finishing, the marathon.\n\nIn 2016 she ran the Chicago Marathon, her third star. After this, Brinkman founded her own race to garner donations for leukemia and lymphoma -- Stampede. It was this race that earned her an invitation to the London Marathon, where she also raised funds for the cause and earned her fourth star in 2017.\n\n\"She's just amazing, with all her running that she's done but also with her philanthropy,\" Gleason said.\n\nSix years later her accomplishments put Brinkman in the path of Abbott World Marathon Majors. Abbott officials invited her to run the Chicago Marathon again, this time for the world champion title for her gender and age group -- 80 and over. She accepted and earned the title in 2023.\n\nAbbott contacted her again and informed her of the Six Star, a special title and award accomplished by finishing all six Major World Marathons: Boston, New York, Chicago, Berlin, London and Tokyo.\n\n\"I had already ran four of them,\" Brinkman said.\n\nThe only remaining races were Berlin and Tokyo. These last two races also proved to be the most difficult for Brinkman.\n\n\"In Berlin we had to go through the Brandenburg Gate in six hours, otherwise they would close it and you would not make it through, and I didn't want to go all that way to Berlin and not make. It was a challenging race, but it turned out well,\" she said.\n\nShe completed the race in 2020 and earned her fifth star. With only one to go, Brinkman could taste victory, but Tokyo had even stricter time requirements. Alongside her running buddy Gleason, Brinkman began to train.\n\n\"In Chicago she just said, 'This is my last marathon, I'm never gonna make it to Tokyo.'\" Gleason said. \"But I said, 'No, don't say that, you will. We're gonna do this, we're gonna keep training.' So we kept training and finally she got word that she got into Tokyo.\"\n\nTokyo was the most challenging of all, Brinkman said.\n\n\"They had checkpoints every three miles so you couldn't just run at your own pace, you had to run according to their speed allotments,\" she said.\n\nShe completed the Tokyo Marathon on March 2 -- earning her sixth and final star -- with a time of six hours, 23 minutes, according to online results. Brinkman is the third-oldest female marathoner to complete the series, and the eighth-oldest contestant across the board to earn the medal.\n\nBrinkman returned home to a crowd of her supporters celebrating her accomplishments. Melissa Vitale, owner of True Grit Running Co. and a friend of Brinkman's, organized the homecoming.\n\n\"Mary Jo is a constant source of inspiration, joy and laughter. I just adore her so much, and I'm so very proud of all that she has accomplished and proud to call her my friend,\" Vitale said.\n\nBrinkman is a member of multiple running organizations including the Western Arkansas and True Grit running clubs. Vitale said Brinkman inspires many members of the clubs.\n\n\"One of our common phrases is, 'I want to be Mary Jo when I grow up,' and it's true,\" Vitale said.\n\nFriends hold signs and greet Mary Jo Brinkman (not pictured) of Fort Smith March 5 as she arrives at the Fort Smith Regional Airport in Fort Smith.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by entertainers and writers of color.\n\nAfter Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, the superstar R&B singer spoke about being thankful about the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.\n\nHe reeled off several of his recent big moments including his sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth studio album \"Coming Home\" and his Super Bowl halftime performance, which became the most-watched in the game's history.\n\nUsher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and Keke Palmer.\n\n\"I don't know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,\" said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey's presence, he thanked those who have supported him throughout the years.\n\n\"This is for you, you, my number ones,\" the singer said as the audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech were recited lyrics from his popular song \"Superstar\" from his 2024 album \"Confessions,\" which has sold more than 10 million units in the U.S.\n\nEarlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President's Award for the singer's public service achievements through his New Look Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl halftime performance last month.\n\n\"The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger woman,\" he said.\n\nBarrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a motion picture.\n\n\"I didn't prepare a speech, because I didn't think I was going to win,\" the singer-actor said. \"I was afraid to play Celie, but I'm glad I did. Because I kept saying 'If I don't win an award, the awards that I will win will come from the people who watched 'Color Purple' and the women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk out.'\"\n\nNew Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.\n\n\"We stand here in brotherhood,\" said Michael Bivins while his group members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.\n\n\"You've seen our story. You know what we've been through,\" said Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.\n\n\"But we call each other every day,\" he continued. \"We text each other every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We're still growing.\"\n\nDamson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role in \"Snowfall.\" Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in \"The Color Purple.\" Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for his role in \"Rustin.\"",

          "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by entertainers and writers of color.\n\nAfter Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, the superstar R&B singer spoke about being thankful about the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.\n\nHe reeled off several of his recent big moments including his sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth studio album \"Coming Home\" and his Super Bowl halftime performance, which became the most-watched in the game's history.\n\nUsher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and Keke Palmer.\n\n\"I don't know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,\" said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey's presence, he thanked those who have supported him throughout the years.\n\n\"This is for you, you, my number ones,\" the singer said as the audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech were recited lyrics from his popular song \"Superstar\" from his 2024 album \"Confessions,\" which has sold more than 10 million units in the U.S.\n\nEarlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President's Award for the singer's public service achievements through his New Look Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl halftime performance last month.\n\n\"The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger woman,\" he said.\n\nBarrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a motion picture.\n\n\"I didn't prepare a speech, because I didn't think I was going to win,\" the singer-actor said. \"I was afraid to play Celie, but I'm glad I did. Because I kept saying 'If I don't win an award, the awards that I will win will come from the people who watched 'Color Purple' and the women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk out.'\"\n\nNew Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame. The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.\n\n\"We stand here in brotherhood,\" said Michael Bivins while his group members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.\n\n\"You've seen our story. You know what we've been through,\" said Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.\n\n\"But we call each other every day,\" he continued. \"We text each other every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We're still growing.\"\n\nDamson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role in \"Snowfall.\" Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in \"The Color Purple.\" Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for his role in \"Rustin.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Dejan Joveljic scored in the third minute and Maya Yoshida added a goal in stoppage time to help the LA Galaxy play St. Louis City to a 3-3 tie on Saturday night.\n\nYoshida flicked in a diving header, off a free kick by Gastón Brugman, from right in front of the goal to make it 3-3 in the fifth minute of stoppage time.\n\nJoveljic finished a series of quick passes with a wide-open side-netter from the center of the area to give Galaxy (1-0-3) a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe 24-year-old striker, in his fourth MLS season, has scored in each game this season, becoming just the eighth player in league history with a goal in his team's first four games of a campaign. Brian McBride scored in each of the first five games of the 1998 season for the Columbus Crew, the only player to accomplish the feat.\n\nTomas Ostrak won the ball from Riqui Puig and scored his first goal of the season from just inside the area to make it 1-1 in the 27th minute. Joseph Paintsil answered to give LA a 2-1 lead int he 51st. The 24-year-old ran onto a long through ball played by Mark Delgado and beat goalkeeper Roman Bürki to score his second goal in the last three games.\n\nJoakim Nilsson netted his first goal in MLS to make it 2-2 in the 60th and an own goal by the Galaxy goalkeeper John McCarthy in the 88th minute gave St. Louis (1-0-3) its first lead of the game at 3-2.\n\nLA's Martín Cáceres, who was shown a yellow card in the 35th minute, was shown a red in the ninth minute of stoppage time for a foul that stopped what appeared to be a scoring opportunity for St. Louis.",

        "body": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin voters are set to decide whether to make it unconstitutional to accept private grant money to help administer state elections, one of two Republican-backed ballot measures that Democrats say are meant to make it harder to conduct elections in the presidential battleground state. A related constitutional amendment on the state's April 2 ballot would allow only election officials designated by law to administer elections. If a majority of voters approve, the amendments would be added to the state's constitution. Since 2020, Republicans in at least 27 states have outlawed or restricted private elections grants. The Wisconsin measures are opposed by an array of government watchdog and liberal groups. Early in-person absentee voting is scheduled to beginTuesday.",

        "body": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) -- Lassina Traore had a career-high 25 points, Marcus Tsohonis scored 25 and hit two clutch free throws with 3.6 seconds remaining to help No. 4 seed Long Beach State beat second-seeded UC Davis 74-70 on Saturday night in the championship game of the Big West Conference Tournament, sending coach Dan Monson to the NCAA Tournament in his final season with the Beach.\n\nIt was an improbable run for the Beach after the school announced on Monday it would part ways with Monson after 17 seasons.\n\nLassina Traore sank 12 of 17 shots and his only free throw for Long Beach State (21-14), which entered the tournament on a five-game losing streak before beating No. 5 seed UC Riverside and top-seeded UC Irvine to reach the final. He added nine rebounds, five of them at the offensive end. Tsohonis hit 8 of 21 shots with four 3-pointers and 5 of 6 foul shots.\n\nAboubacar Traore, no relation to Lussina, finished with seven points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Beach. AJ George added nine points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nTy Johnson paced the Aggies (20-13) with 30 points, six rebounds and four assists. Elijah Pepper hit four 3-pointers and scored 21, adding nine rebounds and three assists.\n\nJohnson had 11 points and Pepper scored 10 to guide UC Davis to a 32-27 advantage at halftime. Tsohonis had 15 points at the break to keep Long Beach State close.\n\nLussina Traore scored 19 in the second half. His rebound basket pulled Long Beach State even at 54-all and George followed with a 3-pointer to give the Beach a 57-54 lead with 7:29 remaining. It was their first lead since 15-12.\n\nUC Davis closed to within a point twice and trailed 72-70 on an Ade Adebayo layup with 4 seconds to go, but Tsohonis was clutch at the line to wrap up the win.\n\nMonson, who started Gonzaga's unprecedented run of success when he led the Bulldogs to the Elite Eight in 1999 before leaving to take over an embattled Minnesota Golden Gophers program and turning Gonzaga's reins over to Mark Few, has the Beach in the Big Dance for the first time since he took them 2012 when LBSU was known as the 49ers.\n\nMonson leaves as the school's winningest coach. He currently has 275 victories against 272 losses.\n\n-- -- -\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

          "body": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) -- Lassina Traore had a career-high 25 points, Marcus Tsohonis scored 25 and hit two clutch free throws with 3.6 seconds remaining to help No. 4 seed Long Beach State beat second-seeded UC Davis 74-70 on Saturday night in the championship game of the Big West Conference Tournament, sending coach Dan Monson to the NCAA Tournament in his final season with the Beach.\n\nIt was an improbable run for the Beach after the school announced on Monday it would part ways with Monson after 17 seasons.\n\nLassina Traore sank 12 of 17 shots and his only free throw for Long Beach State (21-14), which entered the tournament on a five-game losing streak before beating No. 5 seed UC Riverside and top-seeded UC Irvine to reach the final. He added nine rebounds, five of them at the offensive end. Tsohonis hit 8 of 21 shots with four 3-pointers and 5 of 6 foul shots.\n\nAboubacar Traore, no relation to Lussina, finished with seven points, 13 rebounds and six assists for the Beach. AJ George added nine points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nTy Johnson paced the Aggies (20-13) with 30 points, six rebounds and four assists. Elijah Pepper hit four 3-pointers and scored 21, adding nine rebounds and three assists.\n\nJohnson had 11 points and Pepper scored 10 to guide UC Davis to a 32-27 advantage at halftime. Tsohonis had 15 points at the break to keep Long Beach State close.\n\nLussina Traore scored 19 in the second half. His rebound basket pulled Long Beach State even at 54-all and George followed with a 3-pointer to give the Beach a 57-54 lead with 7:29 remaining. It was their first lead since 15-12.\n\nUC Davis closed to within a point twice and trailed 72-70 on an Ade Adebayo layup with 4 seconds to go, but Tsohonis was clutch at the line to wrap up the win.\n\nMonson, who started Gonzaga's unprecedented run of success when he led the Bulldogs to the Elite Eight in 1999 before leaving to take over an embattled Minnesota Golden Gophers program and turning Gonzaga's reins over to Mark Few, has the Beach in the Big Dance for the first time since he took them 2012 when LBSU was known as the 49ers.\n\nMonson leaves as the school's winningest coach. He currently has 275 victories against 272 losses.\n\n-- -- -\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

It got so heated that he said his wife had to get in between the two.\n\n\"I immediately shoved her to the side and put my hand on his chest, not push him but to tell him to give me my space and leave my wife out of this,\" Campbell said.\n\nHe never expected what would come next.\n\n\"I looked down and he had pointed a gun at me through his hoodie and shot me,\" he said.\n\nCaught on camera: Thief uses rock to smash car window, steal backpack\n\nPolice arrived on the scene shortly after to take the man into custody. Campbell was shot once in his side.\n\n\"I'm super swollen because of it all, it entered here on my left side under my lowest rib and ricocheted all over,\" Campbell said. \"The bullet came out on the other side.\"\n\nHe said he has internal damage and a broken right hip.\n\nPolice charged Jonathan Nelson, 35, with assault in the first degree and violation of a protection order, as police say he was prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm or weapon.\n\nNow, Campbell and his wife are uncomfortable to go back to the place they have called home for more than a decade.\n\n\"It's traumatic,\" he said.\n\nCampbell knows he has so many people depending on him and said that's what worries him the most.\n\n\"I have a long road to recovery and I don't know what's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nCampbell's family has set up a Gofundme to help cover medical costs and bills while he's out of work.",

Owners made sure their fur babies were up to snuff for the parade.\n\nThere were plenty of pooches that got to walk in the parade too, including but not limited to the Irish Setter Club of Colorado.\n\nThese dogs are getting pets, rubs and scratches this weekend, but certainly no pinches.",

Tuesday's five-way primary pits him against progressive, anti-violence activist Kina Collins and Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia is also being challenged by Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez. Lopez is the congressman's first primary challenger since 2018, when he first won office.",

But one was too old, too mentally unfit for the job, he said.\n\n\"The other's me,\" Bidden quipped.\n\nThe digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has slipped up, too.\n\n\"Don't tell him, he thinks he's running against Barack Obama, that's what he said,\" said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up way past his bedtime.\n\nIt was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year, traces its history to 1885 -- that was the year President Grover Cleveland refused to attend. Every president since has come to at least one Gridiron.\n\nBiden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump -- who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen -- return to the White House. The speech had echoes of Biden's campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,\" he said. \"An unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin's on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says to him, 'do whatever the hell you want.'\"\n\nBiden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.\n\n\"We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow down,\" he said.\n\nBiden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his daughter Ashley.\n\nThe dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was jam-packed with politicians and who's-who of Washington, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who's in town for St. Patrick's Day, also attended.\n\nAlso speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican.\n\nBiden closed out the dinner, speaking also about the importance of a free press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints, he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershovich and Austin Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting trip in Syria.\n\n\"Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,\" he said. \"We need you.\"\n\nBiden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron president Dan Balz of the Washington Post. Seated also at the table were Balz's bosses, the Post's Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the newspaper's owner, Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No photos or TV were allowed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report.",

          "body": "President Joe Biden attended the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner this weekend, the first time during his presidency\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The big news this week, President Joe Biden said at a weekend Washington roast, was that two candidates had clinched their party's nomination for president. But one was too old, too mentally unfit for the job, he said.\n\n\"The other's me,\" Bidden quipped.\n\nThe digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has slipped up, too.\n\n\"Don't tell him, he thinks he's running against Barack Obama, that's what he said,\" said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up way past his bedtime.\n\nIt was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year, traces its history to 1885 -- that was the year President Grover Cleveland refused to attend. Every president since has come to at least one Gridiron.\n\nBiden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump -- who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen -- return to the White House. The speech had echoes of Biden's campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,\" he said. \"An unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin's on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says to him, 'do whatever the hell you want.'\"\n\nBiden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.\n\n\"We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow down,\" he said.\n\nBiden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his daughter Ashley.\n\nThe dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was jam-packed with politicians and who's-who of Washington, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who's in town for St. Patrick's Day, also attended.\n\nAlso speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican.\n\nBiden closed out the dinner, speaking also about the importance of a free press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints, he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershovich and Austin Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting trip in Syria.\n\n\"Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,\" he said. \"We need you.\"\n\nBiden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron president Dan Balz of the Washington Post. Seated also at the table were Balz's bosses, the Post's Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the newspaper's owner, Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No photos or TV were allowed.\n\nAssociated Press writer Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON: The United States shot down a drone fired by Yemen's Huthi rebels toward the Red Sea and destroyed more of their weaponry on Saturday, its military said.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that on Saturday morning the Huthis launched two drones towards the Red Sea, a commercially vital seaway that the Iranian-backed rebels have targeted dozens of times in the past four months.\n\nCENTCOM forces \"successfully engaged and destroyed one\" drone while the other is presumed to have crashed into the Red Sea, the statement said, adding that there were no reports of damage or injuries from ships in the area.\n\nThe statement came after the Huthis had earlier claimed a drone attack on a US destroyer in the Red Sea, adding that the strike \"achieved its goals.\"\n\nLater Saturday night, CENTCOM \"destroyed five unmanned surface vessels and one\" drone in Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen in \"self-defense,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe flurry of Huthi attacks, including a deadly assault on a bulk carrier last week and the sinking of a ship carrying thousands of tonnes of fertilizer, have triggered reprisal strikes by US and British forces.\n\nSuch exchanges have become a frequent occurrence in the area, sending shipping insurance costs soaring and prompting many firms to detour around the southern tip of Africa.\n\nThe Huthis say they are targeting Israel-linked shipping as part of an \"axis of resistance\" of Iran allies and proxies, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

          "body": "The United States shot down a drone fired by Yemen's Huthi rebels toward the Red Sea and destroyed more of their weaponry on Saturday, its military said.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that on Saturday morning the Huthis launched two drones towards the Red Sea, a commercially vital seaway that the Iranian-backed rebels have targeted dozens of times in the past four months.\n\nCENTCOM forces \"successfully engaged and destroyed one\" drone while the other is presumed to have crashed into the Red Sea, the statement said, adding that there were no reports of damage or injuries from ships in the area.\n\nThe statement came after the Huthis had earlier claimed a drone attack on a US destroyer in the Red Sea, adding that the strike \"achieved its goals.\"\n\nLater Saturday night, CENTCOM \"destroyed five unmanned surface vessels and one\" drone in Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen in \"self-defense,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe flurry of Huthi attacks, including a deadly assault on a bulk carrier last week and the sinking of a ship carrying thousands of tonnes of fertilizer, have triggered reprisal strikes by US and British forces.\n\nSuch exchanges have become a frequent occurrence in the area, sending shipping insurance costs soaring and prompting many firms to detour around the southern tip of Africa.\n\nThe Huthis say they are targeting Israel-linked shipping as part of an \"axis of resistance\" of Iran allies and proxies, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

        "body": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama (KTSM) - The UTEP men's basketball team suffered a 78-71 loss to Western Kentucky in the Conference USA Tournament championship game at Propst Arena on Saturday night.\n\nWith the win, Western Kentucky collected the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. WKU is heading to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2013.\n\nWestern Kentucky's Don McHenry scored 25 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the floor to lead the Hilltoppers to victory. Brandon Newman scored 15 points and Khristian Lander added 11 for Western Kentucky. Babacar Faye grabbed 10 rebounds to go with nine points, three blocks and three steals.\n\nAs for UTEP, its NCAA Tournament drought will continue as it fell to WKU in the CUSA Tournament final. UTEP's last appearance in the NCAA Tournament was 2010. At that time the Miners were led by Tony Barbee as head coach and had standout players like Randy Culpepper, Derrick Caracter, Julyan Stone, and Arnett Moultrie on the squad.\n\nUTEP was led by Zid Powell as he scored 21 points and hit four three-pointers. Otis Frazier III and Tae Hardy contributed 11 points each.\n\nAfter going into halftime down 40-36, UTEP opened up the second half with a 13-4 run to put the Miners up 55-41 - its biggest lead in the entire contest - with 14:45 to go.\n\nAfter a Corey Camper Jr. layup that put UTEP up 53-47 with 13:46 to go, UTEP missed its next eight shots. During that span, WKU outscored UTEP 12-0 to build a 60-53 lead with 8:49 left in the contest.\n\nUTEP then got as close as five points but trailed the rest of the way.\n\nIt wasn't the result UTEP wanted to end its 2023-24 season, but UTEP head coach Joe Golding believes the opportunity to play for a conference tournament championship was a step in the right direction for the program as it wrapped up its third year under the direction of Golding.\n\n\"This fan base has been splintered for about the last decade in my opinion. What I think this team did the last three days is they united this fan base. They united UTEP basketball and that's exactly what had to happen to get this program back to where it belongs,\" UTEP men's basketball head coach Joe Golding said. \"People are proud tonight to wear UTEP basketball around the country. People in El Paso are proud of these guys and that's going to help us moving forward, that's going to help us in recruiting, that's going to help us NIL.\"\n\nThe last time UTEP played in the Conference USA Tournament final was in 2011.\n\n\"We had a lot of chances to give up this year,\" UTEP senior guard Tae Hardy said. \"There was a lot of times where we went through adversity and we could have easily given up, but we kept fighting and we got to where we needed to be. Hopefully this just shows the way for the players that's going to be here next year.\"\n\n\"I'm kind of mad right now. I hate losing, but these last couple of weeks with the team, I know that we all got closer,\" UTEP senior guard Zid Powell said. \"We are going to be in each other's lives for life. I am just happy to say I played for UTEP. I feel like I made the right decision to come here.\"\n\nUTEP ends its 2023-24 season with a 18-16 record and a fifth-place finish in the league standings after a 7-9 campaign in CUSA play.",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- N'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament by defeating Colorado 75-68 on Saturday night in the conference tournament title game to end the Pac-12 basketball era.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) extended its postseason because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes' eight-game winning streak ended.\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. Also for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points and Jermaine Couisnard finished with 14.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points, and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four points with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game. When sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night, so did nearly all of its rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The fans who did show up Saturday, filling maybe half of T-Mobile Arena, were high in energy -- if not numbers.\n\nOregon once again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 Conference home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- N'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament by defeating Colorado 75-68 on Saturday night in the conference tournament title game to end the Pac-12 basketball era.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) extended its postseason because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes' eight-game winning streak ended.\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. Also for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points and Jermaine Couisnard finished with 14.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points, and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four points with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game. When sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night, so did nearly all of its rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The fans who did show up Saturday, filling maybe half of T-Mobile Arena, were high in energy -- if not numbers.\n\nOregon once again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 Conference home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.",

        "body": "Los Angeles (AFP) - Stephen Curry returned from a sprained ankle to score 31 points and reserve Klay Thompson added 26 to spark Golden State over the Los Angeles Lakers 128-121 in an NBA showdown on Saturday.\n\nThe Lakers, who lost forward Anthony Davis after the first quarter to a poke in the left eye, squandered a 40-point performance by LeBron James in falling to the Warriors.\n\n\"A big win for us,\" Curry said. \"I don't know the last time we won in here against them. Big deal.\"\n\nTwo-time NBA Most Valuable Player Curry missed Golden State's past three games and the Warriors are only 1-5 this season without him.\n\nThe 36-year-old guard and four-time NBA champion returned in spectacular fashion, adding six rebounds and five assists while hitting 12-of-24 shots from the floor, and 3-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJames, who hit 15-of-23 shots, added eight points and nine assists and filled in after Davis went to the locker room after the first quarter and did not play again.\n\n\"They always going to talk about me and him,\" Curry said of James. \"It was about our total group tonight. For us, it takes a whole team to win and we needed it -- we needed it bad.\"\n\nDraymond Green contributed 12 rebounds and 13 assists and Jonathan Kuminga added 23 points for Golden State.\n\nThe game was halted for several minutes near the end by a malfunctioning shot clock.\n\n\"I've never seen that in my career. Usually they have a back-up clock or something,\" Curry said.\n\n\"That's the worst thing that could happen, especially this age. You build up all pre-game, you get going and when the engine shuts off it's hard to get it going again.\"\n\nThe Warriors are a percentage point ahead of the Lakers in the last two play-in positions in the Western Conference.\n\nJalen Williams scored 23 points, grabbed seven rebounds and had six assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder grabbed a share of the Western Conference lead by winning 118-112 at Memphis.\n\nThe Thunder matched defending NBA champion Denver atop the West at 47-20.\n\nRookie Chet Holmgren scored 22 points and pulled down 11 rebounds while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 20 points for Oklahoma City.\n\n\"We just had to make winning plays down the stretch,\" Holmgren said. \"It wasn't going our way the whole game but we came together enough to come away with the win.\"\n\nMinnesota moved within a game of the West co-leaders as Anthony Edwards scored 31 points and Mike Conley added 25 in a 119-100 Timberwolves triumph at Utah.\n\nJalen Brunson fired in 42 points to spark the New York Knicks to a 98-91 victory at Sacramento.\n\nTyrese Maxey scored 30 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers over visiting Charlotte 109-98.\n\nCameroonian forward Pascal Siakam poured in 28 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to spark host Indiana over the Brooklyn Nets 121-100.\n\nC.J. McCollum scored 30 points and passed off eight assists while Zion Williamson added 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead New Orleans over visiting Portland 126-107.\n\nJalen Green scored 26 points and pulled down 11 rebounds to lead Houston over visiting Cleveland 117-103, stretching the Rockets' win streak to five games.\n\nAyo Dosunmu scored 34 points and Nikola Vucevic added 29 points and 13 rebounds to spark the Chicago Bulls over visiting NBA doormat Washington 127-98.",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "ATLANTIC CITY -- Corey Washington scored 20 of his 24 points in the second half to rally fifth-seeded Saint Peter's to a 68-63 victory over No. 2 seed Fairfield in the championship game of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament on Saturday night, earning the Peacocks an automatic spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nWashington made 9 of 14 shots from the floor -- 7 of 8 after halftime -- but just 6-of-13 free throws for the Peacocks (19-13), who dropped their final two regular-season games to Rider and Quinnipiac before avenging the losses in the first two rounds of the tourney. He added nine rebounds and blocked four shots.\n\nRoy Clarke had 12 points off the bench for Saint Peter's on 4-for-5 shooting with two 3-pointers. The Peacocks shot 72.2% from the floor in the second half (13 for 18), including 3 of 4 from beyond the arc. They made 14 of 21 at the foul line.\n\nCaleb Fields totaled 17 points, nine rebounds and five assists to pace Fairfield (22-12). Alexis Yetna added 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Brycen Goodine scored 10 off the bench.\n\nYetna had 10 points and eight rebounds to guide Fairfield to a 32-25 advantage at halftime. The Stags took a 10-7 lead on Jasper Floyd's 3-pointer at the 14:10 mark and led all the way to the break.\n\nA 3-pointer from Louis Bleechmore followed by a layup from Jalen Leach gave Fairfield a 39-29 lead just 2:35 into the second half. The Stags stayed in front until Michael Houge followed a Brent Bland 3-pointer with a bucket, putting the Peacocks ahead 42-41 with 11:30 remaining.\n\nSaint Peter's led by nine at the 3:47 mark, but Goodine's layup and hook shot capped an 8-0 spurt and Fairfield trailed 61-60 with 1:19 to go. Washington went 4 for 4 at the foul line as the Peacocks sank 7 of 8 to hold off the Stags.\n\nFairfield has not won the MAAC since 1997. The Stags reached the final after it held Marist without a basket for nearly 10 minutes in the second half, turning a nine-point deficit into a 65-61 victory in the semifinals.\n\nSaint Peter's won the MAAC Tournament and the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament four previous times, most recently in 2022 when the Peacocks advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time.\n\nFairfield 70, Niagara 62\n\nJanelle Brown scored all 15 of her points in the second half to rally Fairfield, and her teammates finished the task in overtime to beat Niagara in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship game for the Stags' 29th straight victory and an NCAA Tournament berth.\n\nBrown, the conference player of the year, split two defenders to give Fairfield its first lead with just under two minutes to go. She had a chance to win the game in regulation but was called for a charge, her fifth foul, and the game went to OT, where the Stags outscored the Eagles 12-4.\n\nKaety L'Amoreaux added 12 points and Emina Selimovic had 11 points, including four in overtime, plus 11 rebounds. Izabela Nicoletti-Leite also scored 11 points for the Stags (31-1), whose only loss came in the third game of the season to Vanderbilt, 73-70.\n\nAmelia Strong scored 14 points, the only Niagara player to reach double figures.\n\nThe Eagles (21-13), the nation's leader in steals and forced turnovers, worked Fairfield into 58 miscues in two regular-season losses. Stags had 27 more in this game but reduced their turnovers to eight in the second half when they rallied from a 13-point deficit. They trailed by seven entering the fourth quarter.\n\nNiagara had 19 turnovers of their own in the often frenetic contest and was only 2-of-11 shooting in the final quarter and 1 of 7 in overtime.\n\nThis will be Fairfield's second championship in three years.",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) - Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nBOSTON (AP) - Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points - one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\nSUNRISE, Fla. (AP) - Steven Stamkos scored two goals, Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 47 shots and Tampa Bay beat Florida.\n\nDarren Raddysh, Michael Eyssimont and Nikita Kucherov also scored for the Lightning, who have won four of five. Vasilevskiy had 16 saves in the second period when Tampa Bay was outshot 18-3.\n\nThe Lightning are four points ahead of the Detroit Red Wings for the top wild card in the Eastern Conference.\n\nSam Reinhart had two goals and Matthew Tkachuk had a goal and an assist as Florida lost its second straight after winning eight of nine. Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 11 saves.\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C. (AP) - Alex Ovechkin scored his 841st career goal and Washington beat Vancouver.\n\nTom Wilson also scored as the Capitals pulled into a tie with the New York Islanders, one point behind Detroit for the second wild-card berth in the Eastern Conference.

Casey DeSmith had 22 saves.\n\nVancouver pulled DeSmith with two minutes left but couldn't beat Lindgren with the extra skater.\n\nVancouver got on the board just 1:11 into the game when Quinn Hughes fired a shot from the faceoff circle and Boeser tipped it in through Lindgren's legs for his team-leading 36th goal of the season.\n\nWith an assist on the play, Hughes got his 77th point of the campaign, setting a new career high. The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\nSEATTLE (AP) - Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) - Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season. With the assist, MacKinnon extended his points streak to 15 games.\n\nSean Walker had both goals in regulation for the Avalanche and Alexandar Georgiev made 32 saves.\n\nWarren Foegele and Sam Carrick scored for the Oilers, who had won two in a row.

LOUIS (AP) - Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win. Jordan Binnington made 22 stops in regulation and OT.\n\nThe Blues and Wild are fighting for playoff positioning in the Western Conference, looking to chase down Vegas for the final wild card. The Golden Knights play Sunday afternoon against New Jersey.\n\nKirill Kaprizov had a goal and an assist for Minnesota, which had won five of six. Marco Rossi also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves through overtime.\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Patrick Kane scored a tiebreaking goal late in the second period and James Reimer stopped 25 shots, lifting Detroit over Buffalo in a matchup of teams vying for a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nDetroit earned a desperately needed win after losing seven straight games in regulation for the first time since early in the 2019-20 season. The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\nCALGARY, Alta. (AP) - Mikael Backlund had two goals and an assist, and Calgary beat Montreal in the first game since coach Martin St. Louis took an indefinite leave because of family reasons.\n\nNazem Kadri had a goal and an assist, helping Calgary to its second straight victory. Martin Pospisil and Daniil Miromanov also scored.\n\nThe Flames remained in distant playoff contention with 15 games remaining in their regular season.\n\nDustin Wolf made 36 saves for his second straight win since Jacob Markstrom was sidelined by a lower-body injury. Markstrom is day to day.\n\nFlames defenceman Mackenzie Weegar had three assists, and winger Jonathan Huberdeau finished with two.\n\nDavid Savard and Cole Caufield scored for Montreal. Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\nDALLAS (AP) - Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) - Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping. His shot beat Kaapo Kahkonen high on the stick side at 14:02.",

          "body": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Artemi Panarin had two goals and three assists, and the New York Rangers zoomed past the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 7-4 win on Saturday.\n\nChris Kreider and K'Andre Miller each had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, who have won four of five to create a sliver of space between themselves and Carolina in the race for first in the Metropolitan Division. Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers. Last season, the Bruins set NHL records for wins (65) and points (135), but were eliminated by the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nJeremy Swayman made 24 saves for Boston, which won for the fourth time in five games.\n\nJoel Farabee had two goals and Ryan Poehling, Nick Deslauriers and Morgan Frost each added one for the Flyers, who have lost four of their last six.\n\nSUNRISE, Fla.

Sergei Bobrovsky finished with 11 saves.\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C. (AP) -- Alex Ovechkin scored his 841st career goal and Washington beat Vancouver.\n\nTom Wilson also scored as the Capitals pulled into a tie with the New York Islanders, one point behind Detroit for the second wild-card berth in the Eastern Conference.

Casey DeSmith had 22 saves.\n\nVancouver pulled DeSmith with two minutes left but couldn't beat Lindgren with the extra skater.\n\nVancouver got on the board just 1:11 into the game when Quinn Hughes fired a shot from the faceoff circle and Boeser tipped it in through Lindgren's legs for his team-leading 36th goal of the season.\n\nWith an assist on the play, Hughes got his 77th point of the campaign, setting a new career high. The Canucks captain also broke the franchise record for points for a defenceman that he set last year when he had 76.\n\nSEATTLE (AP) -- Roman Josi scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the third period, Filip Forsberg scored his 35th of the season into an empty net with 1:20 left and Nashville extended their points streak to 14 games with a win over Seattle.\n\nThe streak is tied for the second-longest in franchise history, equalling a 14-game run during the 2015-16 season. Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina. Pyotr Kochetkov stopped 36 shots.\n\nBurns skated in his 1,400th regular season game, becoming the 42nd player in NHL history to reach the milestone.\n\nJohn Tavares had a goal and an assist, and William Nylander, Nick Robertson and David Kampf also scored for Toronto. Morgan Rielly had two assists and Ilya Samsonov made 36 saves.\n\nToronto was without forwards Mitch Marner (high ankle sprain) and Calle Jarnkrok (hand injury). The Hurricanes played without forward Teuvo Teravainen (upper-body injury).\n\nWith the Hurricanes trailing 4-2 late in the third period and Kochetkov pulled for an extra skater, Aho scored a power-play goal with 1:32 left. Aho then tied with his 27th goal of the season with 5.8 seconds remaining and the team playing 6-on-5 to force OT.\n\nEDMONTON, Alta. (AP) -- Artturi Lehkonen scored with one second remaining in overtime and Colorado battled their way to their sixth straight win, beating the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nNathan MacKinnon sent the puck across to a hard-charging Lehkonen, who scored his 12th of the season. With the assist, MacKinnon extended his points streak to 15 games.\n\nSean Walker had both goals in regulation for the Avalanche and Alexandar Georgiev made 32 saves.\n\nWarren Foegele and Sam Carrick scored for the Oilers, who had won two in a row.

LOUIS (AP) -- Jordan Kyrou and Brayden Schenn scored in the shootout, lifting St. Louis Blues over Minnesota.\n\nKyrou and Schenn also scored in regulation as St. Louis earned its third straight win. Jordan Binnington made 22 stops in regulation and OT.\n\nThe Blues and Wild are fighting for playoff positioning in the Western Conference, looking to chase down Vegas for the final wild card. The Golden Knights play Sunday afternoon against New Jersey.\n\nKirill Kaprizov had a goal and an assist for Minnesota, which had won five of six. Marco Rossi also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 35 saves through overtime.\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Patrick Kane scored a tiebreaking goal late in the second period and James Reimer stopped 25 shots, lifting Detroit over Buffalo in a matchup of teams vying for a wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nDetroit earned a desperately needed win after losing seven straight games in regulation for the first time since early in the 2019-20 season. The slump dropped the Red Wings out of a favourable position to end a post-season drought that dates to 2016.\n\nBuffalo had won three straight, including a 7-3 win over Detroit, to improve its chances of rallying into a playoff spot for the first time since 2011.\n\nTage Thompson had a power-play goal midway through the first period to put Buffalo ahead.\n\nChristian Fischer scored in the second period for Detroit.\n\nCALGARY, Alta. (AP) -- Mikael Backlund had two goals and an assist, and Calgary beat Montreal in the first game since coach Martin St. Louis took an indefinite leave because of family reasons.\n\nNazem Kadri had a goal and an assist, helping Calgary to its second straight victory. Martin Pospisil and Daniil Miromanov also scored.\n\nThe Flames remained in distant playoff contention with 15 games remaining in their regular season.\n\nDustin Wolf made 36 saves for his second straight win since Jacob Markstrom was sidelined by a lower-body injury. Markstrom is day to day.\n\nFlames defenceman Mackenzie Weegar had three assists, and winger Jonathan Huberdeau finished with two.\n\nDavid Savard and Cole Caufield scored for Montreal. Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping. His shot beat Kaapo Kahkonen high on the stick side at 14:02.",

Adam Fox, Mika Zibanejad and Kaapo Kakko also scored.\n\nJonathan Quick made 34 saves to win for the sixth time in his last seven starts.\n\nBryan Rust scored his 20th goal of the season for the Penguins. John Ludvig, Lars Eller and Valtteri Puustinen also scored.\n\nTristan Jarry stopped 17 shots before he was pulled after Miller's eighth goal of the season gave the Rangers a 6-3 lead 4:41 into the third.\n\nNew York is sprinting toward the playoffs behind Panarin, who has seven goals and 17 assists over his last 14 games. His three assists against the Penguins boosted his career total to 500. He has 93 points on the season to become the first player in Rangers history to record at least 90 points three years in a row.\n\nThe Penguins have dropped eight of 10.\n\nElsewhere in the NHL on Saturday:\n\n---\n\nBRUINS 6 FLYERS 5\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Charlie Coyle scored the tying and go-ahead goals, John Beecher and Jake DeBrusk added insurance markers 19 seconds apart early in the third period, and Boston held off Philadelphia in a wild third period that included seven goals.\n\nMorgan Geekie and Danton Heinen each added a goal for Boston, which moved a point ahead of Florida for the league's top record with 95 points -- one more than the Panthers.

Nashville earned points in 15 straight during the 2017-18 season, a stretch during which it went 14-0-1.\n\nThe Predators are 12-0-2 during this stretch and strengthened their hold on the top wild-card spot in the Western Conference.\n\nJosi snapped a 1-1 tie when he scored 9 seconds into a Nashville power play at 3:59 of the period. Josi's second goal came off an offensive zone faceoff and his slap shot from the blue line beat Seattle's Philipp Grubauer, who was screened on the play.\n\nIt was Josi's second multi-goal game in the last few weeks after he netted a pair in a win over Ottawa that was the sixth game as part of Nashville's points streak.\n\n---\n\nHURRICANES 5 MAPLE LEAFS 4 (SO)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Jake Guentzel scored in the shootout and Carolina rallied from two goals down late to beat Toronto.\n\nSebastian Aho had two goals and an assist, Jordan Martinook and Seth Jarvis also scored, and Guentzel and Brent Burns each had two assists for Carolina.

Cayden Primeau made 23 saves.\n\nCalgary opened a 5-2 lead with two goals in the first 3:54 of the third period.\n\n---\n\nSTARS 4 KINGS 1\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Scott Wedgewood made 27 saves to win a matchup of backup goaltenders and defenceman Thomas Harley had a goal and an assist to help lead the Dallas past Los Angeles.\n\nWedgewood beat the Kings for the second time in eight days. Craig Smith, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn also scored for the Stars, who took a 3-0 first-period lead and avoided losing a third consecutive game in regulation loss for the first time since April 2022.\n\nDallas also swept the three-game season series against Los Angeles by a combined 13-3.\n\nDavid Rittich stopped 25 shots for the Kings, who split a road back-to-back after winning 5-0 at Chicago on Friday night. Rittich entered with a career-best 2.19 goals-against average.\n\nKevin Fiala had the Kings' only goal against Wedgewood for the second straight meeting.\n\n---\n\nBLUE JACKETS 4 SHARKS 2\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Alex Nylander scored twice and added an assist, Daniil Tarasov stopped 39 shots, and Columbus snapped a three-game losing streak with win over San Jose.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau had a goal and two assists, and Boone Jenner added a goal and an assist as Columbus beat the Sharks for the fourth straight time in a game between the two teams in last place in their respective conferences.\n\nFabian Zetterlund and Henry Thrun scored goals and Magnus Chrona stopped 16 shots for the Sharks, who have lost 12 of their last 13 games and have the NHL's worst record with just 39 points.\n\nJenner got Columbus on the board with 2:19 left in the first period, shovelling the puck under Chrona's pads after a feed from Gaudreau.\n\nNylander's score from the right circle made it 2-0 Columbus 49 seconds into the second period. He became the first Blue Jacket to score seven goals in his first 11 games with the team.\n\n---\n\nCOYOTES 4 DEVILS 1\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Karel Vejmelka stopped 37 shots and Arizona rode a three-goal first period to a victory over New Jersey.\n\nJ.J. Moser, Dylan Guenther, Logan Cooley and Clayton Keller scored for the Coyotes. Nick Schmaltz assisted on three of the goals. Keller also had an assist on Guenther's goal, giving him 400 career points. Shane Doan is the only other player to reach that mark during the franchise's 28 years in Arizona.\n\nNick DeSimone scored for New Jersey, which has lost six of its last eight games and missed another chance to make up ground in the playoff race. The Devils entered Saturday four points out of the final wild-card spot in the East.\n\nMoser opened the scoring at 9:37 with a wrist shot from between the circles. Guenther's goal, his 10th of the season, came on the power play after Tomas Nosek was called for tripping.

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Central Washington came into the NCAA Division II Tournament as one of the hottest teams in the West Bracket.\n\nThe Wildcats won seven games in a row dating back to Feb. 29.\n\nThat was until they met Azusa Pacific.\n\nThe eighth-seeded Cougars slipped by No. 5 Central Washington with a 82-74 win to continue their Cinderella run to the Sweet Sixteen at Cal State LA on Saturday night.\n\nAzusa Pacific entered the Pac West Conference as the No. 6 seed out of eight teams and ran the table. It then knocked off the top seed and host Cal State LA on Friday.\n\n\"That's a really good team,\" Central Washington coach Brandon Rinta said of Azusa Pacific. \"They played well tonight.\"\n\nThe Cougars not only entered the the bracket as the hottest team but also one of the tallest teams.\n\nTheir front court featured 6-foot-11 Kaleb Taylor and 6-foot-8 Ken West, and right away they created mismatches inside with three back-to-basket shots.\n\nCentral Washington tried to match Azusa at first but its leading scorer and center, Saamad Hector, left the game three minutes into the first half with a left shoulder dislocation. He did not return.\n\n\"The game of basketball is so much about matchups and it really hurt our ability to capitalize,\" Rinta said. \"When you pop your shoulder out you can't use that arm. I know if he could have fought through it he would have.\"\n\nCentral Washington kept its composure and fought back to tie the game midway through the half with a circus shot by Cavin Holden. It took the lead a few minutes later when Holden hit a 3-pointer.\n\nHolden and teammate Jello Lloyd kept the offense moving using their speed to attack the basket,\n\nThe two players were held to just a combined 10 points last night but Holden finished with a game-high 24 points while Lloyd added 22 points. Together they kept the Wildcats within reach and continued to fight with their teammate on the sidelines.\n\n\"It shook me,\" Holden said about Hector's injury. \"I thought he would have been able to get back into the game.\"\n\nCentral Washington went into halftime down just two points and and even took the lead when Hector's backup, Mitch Brizee, made a shot in the paint.\n\nBut Azusa Pacific just wouldn't go away. West not only showed his ability to score inside but also came out and hit a 3-pointer from he top of the key.\n\nThe Cougars eventually went on a run that saw Ethan Speaker complete a three-point play and drove the dagger in deeper when he hit a 3-pointer from the corner.\n\nCentral Washington finished its season not only with physical accomplishments such as 22 wins, a GNAC Tournament Championship, and a NCAA Tournament win but also something else that can help next season.\n\nThe Wildcats graduate just three players in Hector, Lloyd and Camron McNeil and for those returning, the loss to Azusa Pacific created a chip on their shoulder.\n\n\"We have to come back and go even further,\" Holden said.\n\nAnd his coach couldn't agree more.\n\n\"Chips are always good to have,\" Rinta said. \"In sports you can never be satisfied. Not until it is over. \"\n\nCENTRAL -- Cavin Holden 24, Anjaylo Lloyd 22, Bradley Swillie 9, Jordan Clark 5, Camron McNeil 5, Mitch Brizee 4, Colby Kennett 2, Seth Dawson 2, Maverick Sanders 1\n\nAZUSA PACIFIC -- Ken West 21, Bryce Sloan 20, George Reidy 18, Ethan Speaker 13, Kaleb Taylor 4, Allan McBride 4, Trevan Martin 2",

        "body": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- Detrick Leggett noticed long ago that his son, Ishmael, loved sports. So, he made a point of accompanying him on a journey that led to two basketball scholarships, first at Rhode Island and last year to Pitt.\n\n\"Always involved,\" Renee Leggett, Ishmael's mother, said proudly Friday night from her seat above the floor at Capital One Arena during Pitt's ACC Tournament semifinal game against North Carolina.\n\nWhile driving his son to practice during his freshman year at St. John's College High School in Washington D.C., Detrick Leggett suffered a major stroke.\n\nThe car was involved in a minor accident. Nobody was hurt, but the stroke left Detrick paralyzed and unable to speak and led to three surgeries and a six-month stay in the hospital.\n\nBut he's still able to listen, comprehend and answer when he speaks with friends and family -- often with a thumbs-up.\n\nSo there he was Thursday and Friday, perched in his wheelchair in an end zone box, watching Ishmael and his Pitt teammates chase an ACC championship.\n\nThe quest fell short, but not before father and son realized a dream.\n\nIt had been two years since Detrick had been to one of his son's games. That was during the 2021-2022 season when Ishmael played for Rhode Island.\n\n\"Except for on TV and on his app,\" Renee Leggett said. \"Ish sends him all the videos.\"\n\nBack home and playing in front of his dad, Ishmael was especially locked and focused. He scored 30 points to lead Pitt's quarterfinal round victory against Wake Forest, 81-69. His point total was one short of Justin Champagnie's Pitt record in an ACC Tournament game, set in 2020 against Wake Forest. He also was the first ACC player to come off the bench to score 30 since Virginia Tech's Zach LeDay did so in 2017.\n\n\"He was so proud,\" Renee said of Detrick. \"That ride home, he kept looking at everything that was on social media. He kept looking at all the photos. His phone was ringing.\"\n\nThe night was special to Detrick because sports had been such an important part of their lives while Ishmael was growing up. Renee said Detrick was by his son's side the entire time, coaching and counseling.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was something that you dream about,\" Renee said. \"(Ishmael) dreamed about being able to play in front of his dad and doing great and really showing him that all their hard work when he was small paid off.\n\n\"He always said, 'I want to continue what my dad started.' \"",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Dylan Cardwell waved to fans, turned a corner toward the locker room and then the 6-foot-11 center celebrated with a cartwheel.\n\nThe senior backup scored his only points on consecutive dunks in the final minutes as No. 12 Auburn held off ninth-seeded Mississippi State 73-66 on Saturday to reach the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship game.\n\n\"That was really a game changer that I feel like gave us a spark to everybody,\" Auburn's Chad Baker-Mazara said. \"It helped us get the crowd involved, too. It was a really big play. He came in, he came in clutch, turned the whole momentum around.\"\n\nWith the SEC's top three seeds losing their openers Friday for the first time since 1983, that left a wide-open path for Auburn (26-7) to win the tournament for the first time since 2019. The Tigers are in the title game for the fifth time in program history.\n\nAuburn will face Florida, a 95-90 winner over Texas A&M, on Sunday as the program goes for its third title. The Tigers showed some toughness on Saturday, handling the physical Bulldogs with their first win by single digits this season.\n\n\"It was a rock fight because both teams were playing really, really physical,\" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. \"That's Mississippi State's MO. Our MO is playing hard all the time, not always quite as physical. They beat us on the boards, but we hung in there. We hung in there. I thought that was really important.\"\n\nBaker-Mazara led five Tigers in double figures with 14 points. Denver Jones and Jaylin Williams each added 13. Johni Broome and Tre Donaldson had 10 apiece.\n\nJosh Hubbard scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half, trying to rally Mississippi State (21-13). The Bulldogs go home a game shy of the championship, continuing a drought that started after their last berth in 2010.\n\n\"We had our chances,\" second-year coach Chris Jans said.\n\nD.J. Jeffries had 12 points for Mississippi State, and Tolu Smith II had 10.\n\nMississippi State had pulled to within 57-56 on seven straight points when Cardwell seized the moment. His first dunk came with 4:40 left, he blocked a 3-point try by Hubbard and then dunked again with 4:08 remaining before running over in front of some Auburn fans and yelling with a big fist pump in celebration.\n\nThis was a chippy game, with double technicals handed out not once but twice. Broome needed a trainer to treat his nose at one point early in the second half with the Tigers up 39-35.\n\nMississippi State led 31-29 before Williams beat the buzzer driving to the basket for a layup, tying it up at 31 going into halftime after Auburn trailed 12-4 early. Broome's 3 in the opening minute of the second half put the Tigers ahead to stay.\n\n\"We lost our composure, especially myself,\" Jeffries said of the Bulldogs' issues in the second half.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMississippi State: The Bulldogs dominated the boards with a 37-29 edge. But after a 10-1 scoring edge off second-chance points by halftime, Auburn had a 19-15 edge on the boards and a 4-2 difference on second-chance points after halftime. ... The Bulldogs also hurt themselves at the free-throw line, going 17 of 27 (63%).\n\nAuburn: Pearl joined Sonny Smith as the only coaches in program history to reach the title game multiple times. Smith went 1-1 in his trips in 1984 and '85. The Tigers also went in 2000, and Pearl led them to the title in 2019.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season.

          "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- -- Dylan Cardwell waved to fans, turned a corner toward the locker room and then the 6-foot-11 center celebrated with a cartwheel.\n\nThe senior backup scored his only points on consecutive dunks in the final minutes as No. 12 Auburn held off ninth-seeded Mississippi State 73-66 on Saturday to reach the Southeastern Conference Tournament championship game.\n\n\"That was really a game changer that I feel like gave us a spark to everybody,\" Auburn's Chad Baker-Mazara said. \"It helped us get the crowd involved, too. It was a really big play. He came in, he came in clutch, turned the whole momentum around.\"\n\nWith the SEC's top three seeds losing their openers Friday for the first time since 1983, that left a wide-open path for Auburn (26-7) to win the tournament for the first time since 2019. The Tigers are in the title game for the fifth time in program history.\n\nThey will face either Texas A&M or Florida as they try to win Auburn's third title. The Tigers showed some toughness, handling the physical Bulldogs with their first win by single digits this season.\n\n\"It was a rock fight because both teams were playing really, really physical,\" Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. \"That's Mississippi State's MO. Our MO is playing hard all the time, not always quite as physical. They beat us on the boards, but we hung in there. We hung in there. I thought that was really important.\"\n\nBaker-Mazara led five Tigers in double figures with 14 points. Denver Jones and Jaylin Williams each added 13. Johni Broome and Tre Donaldson had 10 apiece.\n\nJosh Hubbard scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half, trying to rally Mississippi State (21-13). The Bulldogs go home a game shy of the championship, continuing a drought that started after their last berth in 2010.\n\n\"We had our chances,\" second-year coach Chris Jans said.\n\nD.J. Jeffries had 12 points for Mississippi State, and Tolu Smith II had 10.\n\nMississippi State had pulled to within 57-56 on seven straight points when Cardwell seized the moment. His first dunk came with 4:40 left, he blocked a 3-point try by Hubbard and then dunked again with 4:08 remaining before running over in front of some Auburn fans and yelling with a big fist pump in celebration.\n\nThis was a chippy game, with double technicals handed out not once but twice. Broome needed a trainer to treat his nose at one point early in the second half with the Tigers up 39-35.\n\nMississippi State led 31-29 before Williams beat the buzzer driving to the basket for a layup, tying it up at 31 going into halftime after Auburn trailed 12-4 early. Broome's 3 in the opening minute of the second half put the Tigers ahead to stay.\n\n\"We lost our composure, especially myself,\" Jeffries said of the Bulldogs' issues in the second half.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nMississippi State: The Bulldogs dominated the boards with a 37-29 edge. But after a 10-1 scoring edge off second-chance points by halftime, Auburn had a 19-15 edge on the boards and a 4-2 difference on second-chance points after halftime. ... The Bulldogs also hurt themselves at the free-throw line, going 17 of 27 (63%).\n\nAuburn: Pearl joined Sonny Smith as the only coaches in program history to reach the title game multiple times. Smith went 1-1 in his trips in 1984 and '85. The Tigers also went in 2000, and Pearl led them to the title in 2019.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAuburn beat Texas A&M 66-55 on Jan. 9 but lost on the road at Florida 81-65 on Feb. 10.",

        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "New York: The permanent delegation of Qatar virtually organized a side event on the margins of the 68th annual Commission on the Status of Women (CSW68) under the theme of empowering women: women in nuclear and related fields.\n\nThe event was held in partnership with the permanent delegations of the Republic of The Gambia and the Republic of Malta to the United Nations (UN) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) with the participation of Representative of Director General of IAEA to UN Vivian Okeke, alongside a host of permanent delegates to the UN and nuclear fields experts.\n\nAddressing the event, Permanent Representative of Qatar to the UN H E Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al Thani underlined Qatar's steadfast belief in the importance of women's engagement in the fields related to nuclear energy, sciences, and technology, as well as engineering and mathematics as the key for preparing a more balanced workforce that supports the sustainable development goals.\n\nThe Qatari women currently excel in generating scientific grades in sciences and mathematics compared to many counterparts in the advanced countries, Her Excellency pointed out, adding that the Qatari women have succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and entered new career pathways that are traditionally dominated by men.\n\nShe stressed that women in Qatar account for 51.6 percent of all undergraduate engineering students, affirming that Qatar has made this success by virtue of multiple beneficial efforts such as the initiatives of Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) that support women-led projects, research and development in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nShe indicated that Hamad Bin Khalifa University offers scholarships for graduate studies in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics for both genders with the aim of drawing talented students globally, along with ambitious women who diligently aspire to work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas.\n\nStrengthening the women's engagement in those critical fields will significantly contribute to achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030, along with the sustainable development goals at the local and regional levels, she said.\n\nThe aforementioned event was intended to encourage the women's presence in nuclear and nuclear-related fields to address the challenges facing the world, such as climate change, the growing number of populations, food insecurity and the increasing demand for energy.",

          "body": "New York: The permanent delegation of Qatar virtually organized a side event on the margins of the 68th annual Commission on the Status of Women (CSW68) under the theme of empowering women: women in nuclear and related fields.\n\nThe event was held in partnership with the permanent delegations of the Republic of The Gambia and the Republic of Malta to the United Nations (UN) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) with the participation of Representative of Director General of IAEA to UN Vivian Okeke, alongside a host of permanent delegates to the UN and nuclear fields experts.\n\nAddressing the event, Permanent Representative of Qatar to the UN H E Sheikha Alya Ahmed bin Saif Al Thani underlined Qatar's steadfast belief in the importance of women's engagement in the fields related to nuclear energy, sciences, and technology, as well as engineering and mathematics as the key for preparing a more balanced workforce that supports the sustainable development goals.\n\nThe Qatari women currently excel in generating scientific grades in sciences and mathematics compared to many counterparts in the advanced countries, Her Excellency pointed out, adding that the Qatari women have succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and entered new career pathways that are traditionally dominated by men.\n\nShe stressed that women in Qatar account for 51.6 percent of all undergraduate engineering students, affirming that Qatar has made this success by virtue of multiple beneficial efforts such as the initiatives of Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) that support women-led projects, research and development in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nShe indicated that Hamad Bin Khalifa University offers scholarships for graduate studies in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics for both genders with the aim of drawing talented students globally, along with ambitious women who diligently aspire to work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas.\n\nStrengthening the women's engagement in those critical fields will significantly contribute to achieving the Qatar National Vision 2030, along with the sustainable development goals at the local and regional levels, she said.\n\nThe aforementioned event was intended to encourage the women's presence in nuclear and nuclear-related fields to address the challenges facing the world, such as climate change, the growing number of populations, food insecurity and the increasing demand for energy.",

It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.",

          "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stephen Curry belatedly celebrated his birthday by returning to the Golden State lineup and leading the Warriors to a much-needed victory.\n\nCurry, who turned 36 on Thursday, scored 31 points after missing the last three games with a sprained right ankle as the Warriors beat the Los Angeles Lakers 128-121 on Saturday night in a pivotal Western Conference matchup.\n\n\"Steph is Steph. He's just amazing,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"He got off to a slow start, but he never worries and we never worry. What he does is open the floor for everyone else.\"\n\nThe Warriors inched ahead of the Lakers by a percentage point into ninth place in the West after winning a game that dragged to the finish because of a pair of replay reviews -- one that overturned an apparent 3-pointer by LeBron James -- then a malfunctioning clock.\n\nJames had 40 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. D'Angelo Russell added 23 points and 13 assists for the Lakers, who have dropped their last two.\n\nIf the season ended Saturday, the Warriors would be hosting the Lakers in the play-in tournament, with the loser eliminated. Both teams are 3 1/2 games behind Phoenix for sixth place and escaping the play-in games, but time is running out.\n\n\"I was excited just to be back. You understand the ramifications down the stretch. Every game, especially against teams jumbled right there in the play-in, matters,\" said Curry, who was 12 of 24 from the field along with six rebounds and five assists in 31 minutes.\n\nKlay Thompson added 26 off the bench and Jonathan Kuminga 23 as the Warriors dominated play inside and regularly drove to the rim after Lakers All-Star center Anthony Davis did not play the final three periods after he was poked in the eye late in the first quarter.\n\nGolden State took advantage of Davis' injury as it dominated inside. The Warriors outrebounded the Lakers by six and had a 62-54 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nDraymond Green was held to six points, but had 13 assists and 12 rebounds after he missed the last game due to back soreness.\n\nCurry had six points during a 10-2 third-quarter run that gave the Warriors a 91-79 lead. Neither team had more than a seven-point lead until that point.\n\n\"They made some adjustments at halftime. In the third quarter we came out and missed some really good shots after getting some good looks. They played better than we did in the third,\" James said.\n\nThompson had 21 points in the first half as the Warriors held a 67-66 lead at halftime. It was the second time this season Thompson has scored at least 20 in the first half.\n\nJames, who was 6 of 16 from the field in Wednesday night's loss at Sacramento, was 15 of 23 against the Warriors. He hit his first six shots, including three 3-pointers.\n\nA 3-pointer by Thompson with 7:41 remaining in the fourth quarter gave the Warriors a 113-101 advantage, before the Lakers started to slowly work their way back.\n\nJames appeared to hit a 3-pointer with 2:07 remaining to get the Lakers within four, but during a stoppage in play 17 seconds later, the replay center determined James' foot was out of bounds and took the basket away.\n\nThe reversal ended any momentum for the Lakers. The Warriors put away the game when Curry stole the ball from James and passed it to Kuminga for a breakaway dunk to make it 126-117.\n\n\"We dig back into it, and make a big shot. Guys are scrambling, competing and then boom, everything just stops. So it just took the rhythm out of the game,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWarriors: Host the New York Knicks on Monday.\n\nLakers: Host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

        "title": "Luis Gil may fill Yankees' rotation spot amid Gerrit Cole injury",
        "body": "TAMPA -- Luis Gil was optioned out of camp back on March 3, a transaction that made sense for a prospect building up slowly after Tommy John surgery.\n\nBut a lot has changed in the past two weeks, including a Gerrit Cole injury that has opened up a rotation spot and Gil flashing some of the most dominant stuff in Yankees camp.\n\nThe 25-year-old righty was a standout for a second straight outing, cruising through a representative Blue Jays lineup Saturday just like he had a representative Phillies lineup Tuesday -- a start that manager Aaron Boone called \"probably the outing of the spring by anyone.\"\n\nThrough four games and two starts in the Grapefruit League, Gil has allowed three runs in 11 ²/₃ innings (2.31 ERA) with 18 strikeouts and four walks.\n\nOpposing hitters are batting .125 against Gil, who is \"right in the conversation\" for fifth starter, Boone said.\n\n\"Really good to see him having confidence to be able to throw his secondary stuff for strikes, which allows his heater, which is elite, to play up,\" Boone said after Gil let up a hit and a walk while striking out four in 3 ¹/₃ scoreless innings in a 10-9 win over the Blue Jays at Steinbrenner Field.\n\nGil might have lacked the ridiculous stuff he featured against the Phillies, when he struck out eight in 3 ²/₃ innings, but his fastball touched 99.1 mph, and his slider and new changeup consistently kept legitimate Toronto hitters off-balance.\n\nIn the first inning, Bo Bichette swung through a pair of changeups -- a pitch that Gil did not have much of a feel for before surgery -- for the strikeout.\n\nKevin Kiermaier missed the changeup, too, for his final strike. Cavan Biggio chased a slider for his strikeout.\n\nGil's final pitch of the third inning was a 98.9 mph heater that blew away Bichette for a second time. Gil's motion finished with his back to the plate, and he took a moment facing the center-field wall to celebrate the strikeout.\n\nThe Yankees will be careful building up a pitcher who debuted with promise in 2021 and made one start the following season before needing Tommy John surgery.\n\nGil made it back to the mound with a couple of September appearances with Low-A Tampa last year.\n\nGil built up to 56 pitches Saturday, and \"we'll see\" if he will stretch out enough to be ready for a full workload when the season begins, Boone said.\n\nHis competition includes starters with major league experience (Cody Poteet and Luke Weaver) as well as a few prospects (Will Warren, who is not on the 40-man roster, and Clayton Beeter).\n\n\"I feel like we have a number of different choices to consider, and that's a good thing,\" general manager Brian Cashman said. \"A number of people have thrown well, whether it's what Gil just recently showed us -- and we already know what he had done prior to the Tommy John surgery and we know what he's capable of. What Warren continues to do, Beeter has had a good camp and shown his wares here in his first major league camp. Poteet has done well. Luke Weaver has been there and done that.\n\n\"I think we'll just have a lot of conversations wrapped around at least all those guys.\"\n\nGil said his mindset has not changed through camp, even if his status among Yankees starting pitchers has taken a leap.\n\n\"I don't make those decisions,\" Gil said through interpreter Marlon Abreu of the competition. \"If I'm given the opportunity [to be the fifth starter], I'll be there for it.\"",

        "title": "US agency engages SpaceX to build spy satellites",
        "body": "WASHINGTON: SpaceX is building a network of hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a US intelligence agency, five sources familiar with the programme said, demonstrating deepening ties between billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company and national security agencies.\n\nThe network is being built by SpaceX's Starshield business unit under a $1.8 billion contract signed in 2021 with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), an intelligence agency that manages spy satellites, the sources said.\n\nThe plans show the extent of SpaceX's involvement in US intelligence and military projects and illustrate a deeper Pentagon investment into vast, low-Earth orbiting satellite systems aimed at supporting ground forces. If successful, the sources said the programme would significantly advance the ability of the US government and military to quickly spot potential targets almost anywhere on the globe.\n\nThe contract signals growing trust by the intelligence establishment of a company whose owner has clashed with the Biden administration and sparked controversy over the use of Starlink satellite connectivity in the Ukraine war, the sources said.\n\nThe organisation says it is developing a 'resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance system'\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February the existence of a $1.8 billion classified Starshield contract with an unknown intelligence agency without detailing the purposes of the programme.\n\nReuters reporting discloses for the first time that the SpaceX contract is for a powerful new spy system with hundreds of satellites bearing Earth-imaging capabilities that can operate as a swarm in low orbits, and that the spy agency that Musk's company is working with is the NRO. In a statement the NRO acknowledged its mission to develop a sophisticated satellite system and its partnerships with other government agencies, companies, research institutions and nations, but declined to comment on findings about the extent of SpaceXs involvement in the effort.\n\n\"The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe satellites can track targets on the ground and share that data with US intelligence and military officials, the sources said. In principle, that would enable the US government to quickly capture continuous imagery of activities on the ground nearly anywhere on the globe, aiding intelligence and military operations, they added.\n\nRoughly a dozen prototypes have been launched since 2020, among other satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, three of the sources said.\n\nA US government database of objects in orbit shows several SpaceX missions having deployed satellites that neither the company nor the government have ever acknowledged. Two sources confirmed those to be prototypes for the Starshield network.The Pentagon is already a big SpaceX customer, using its Falcon 9 rockets to launch military payloads into space.",

        "title": "Oregon beats Colorado 75-68 for final Pac-12 Tournament title and NCAA Tournament berth",
        "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The end likely came for Pac-12 Conference basketball on Saturday. It also marked the beginning of an unexpected journey for Oregon.\n\nThe Ducks had to win the conference tournament to get into the NCAA Tournament. And behind a hurting big man who was perfect on this night, they found a way.\n\nN'Faly Dante, playing with a bruised tailbone, made all 12 of his shots and scored 25 points, and Oregon secured an automatic bid by defeating Colorado 75-68.\n\nBy winning the conference tournament, fourth-seeded Oregon (23-11) will play in the big tourney because the Ducks weren't projected to receive an at-large invitation to the 68-team field. This was the Ducks' sixth Pac-12 Tournament championship and first since 2019.\n\n\"We knew what we had to come down here and do,\" said Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard, who had 14 points and eight assists. \"We knew we had to win three straight.\"\n\nThird-seeded Colorado (23-10) is expected to receive an at-large bid. The Buffaloes, whose eight-game winning streak ended, entered the game 24th in the NCAA's NET ranking.\n\n\"I have coached teams that have deserved to be in that weren't in, and I've also coached teams that didn't deserve to be in that got in,\" Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle said. \"All that matters is what that committee thinks. I look at our metrics, I look at these guys and there's no doubt in my mind this is an NCAA Tournament team.\"\n\nDante, who was injured in Friday's semifinal victory over Arizona, also had nine rebounds and three steals and was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He picked up his third foul 2:19 into the second half, but never got a fourth and ended the game with a plus-19 rating.\n\n\"It feels really good,\" Dante said. \"It was something I wanted to do since I stepped on campus. I am glad I was able to do something to help the team. I am proud of this team and my teammates.\"\n\nDante made all 10 shots in the Ducks' previous meeting with Colorado, making him 22 for 22.\n\n\"I thought N'Faly Dante was the difference in the game,\" Boyle said. \"We were trying to double him and he scored out of double teams. He changed shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nAlso for Oregon, Jackson Shelstad scored 17 points.\n\nKJ Simpson led the Buffaloes with 23 points and Luke O'Brien had 11.\n\nOregon's defense forced Colorado into 12 turnovers and the Ducks outscored the Buffaloes 21-0 off giveaways.\n\nThe score was tied at 62 when Shelstad made two free throws and Jadrian Tracey had a layup to put the Ducks ahead by four with 2:41 left. They never trailed again.\n\nThe atmosphere wasn't quite what might be expected of a historical conference playing, for now at least, its final basketball game, but it was better than expected given sixth-ranked Arizona bowed out Friday night. When the Wildcats left, so did nearly all of their rabid fans who flocked to what has become known as McKale North. The 12,912 fans who did show up in their place were high in energy.\n\n\"It hurts that we're not going to have a Pac-12,\" Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \"We won the first one here in 2013 when it moved to Vegas and we're winning the last one here in Vegas. Vegas has been really good to us. We're going to miss that. ... I'm really going to miss the Pac-12.\"\n\nOregon again was part of a final Pac-12 event, having also played in the football championship in December. The Ducks and three of their brethren will be headed to the Big Ten Conference in the coming months.\n\nColorado and three other Pac-12 teams will soon call the Big 12 home, and California and Stanford will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Only Oregon State and Washington State remain behind, determined to preserve the Pac-12 in some way, even naming Teresa Gould as league commissioner for the next two years.\n\nWhether those two schools find a way to keep the conference alive remains to be seen, and in the meantime they will align with the Mountain West in football and West Coast Conference in other sports. A full merger at some point is a possibility.\n\nGone for certain is the Pac-12 as it's long been known, the so-called Conference of Champions with a rich basketball history, with Saturday night's championship game the last notable event in that sport.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nOregon: The Ducks showed few signs they would run the table this week. They needed to win three games in a row, but hadn't done that since early January. Oregon also was 1-5 against the three tournament teams it defeated.\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes were projected as a 10-seed by ESPN and an 11-seed by CBS. Teams with rankings in the 20s in the NET and Kenpom are usually secure, but this has been a wacky postseason with teams grabbing unexpected bids around the country. That add some drama to selection Sunday for the Buffs.\n\n___\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on AP Top 25 basketball throughout the season. Sign up here.\n\n___",

        "body": "LAKEVIEW, Ohio (AP) -- Residents of a region of Central America hit by a deadly hurricane spent Saturday cleaning up, assessing damage and helping neighbors. But it will be a long recovery from the storms that swept through parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Arkansas.\n\nStorms Thursday night Three lives were lost One of the hardest-hit areas was the Indian Lake area of Logan County, Ohio, and an Indiana community where about 40 people were injured and dozens of homes were damaged. Tornadoes were also reported in Illinois and Missouri.\n\nSamantha Snipes, 33, said when she first heard the tornado warning, she called her father, who lives seven minutes away, to take cover. He told The Associated Press that he was trying to get into a closet in his childhood home and then the phone was cut off.\n\nShe and her husband tried to reach him on the main road but could not and had to take a back route after the cyclone passed.\n\n\"It was out of a movie like 'Twister,'\" he said. \"My dad's garage was leveled. The back of his house is gone. It's like everything's gone.\"\n\nThey clambered over everything screaming for him. When they found him, he was unhurt and told him to stop crying, she said.\n\nHer father, Joe Baker, told his children to hide in the closet in case a tornado ever hit.\n\n\"We grew up here. It's our childhood home,\" said Snipes, who spent Saturday throwing things away and figuring out what could be saved. \"You see it on the news. But you never imagine it happening to you.\n\nSteve Wills, a pastor who owns a vacation home on Orchard Island, said Saturday he had a family crew clean up and patch up a hole in the roof.\n\n\"We grieve for the families who lost their lives. There are three deaths in our society. You know, it breaks our hearts,\" Wills said. \"But it could have been more, it could have been more. Yeah, so I still have hope.\n\nThe community was really helpful, Snipes said.\n\nThe school superintendent was dropping off food, clothes and diapers on Friday. The night of the tornado, neighbors on her dad's street were going door-to-door stopping for gas, she said.\n\n\"Everyone who travels on this road is safe. You know neighbors helping neighbors,\" Snipes said.",

PAUL, Minn. -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shut out in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United.",

(AP) -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shutout in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport",

        "title": "Why are so many voters frustrated by the U.S. economy? It's home prices",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Lori Shelton can't fathom ever having the money to buy a home -- and that's a major reason why so many voters feel down on the economy ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nShelton, 67, drives an Uber to help pay rent in Aurora, Colorado. An advance on her pay covered her apartment's security deposit. But it also cut into her next paycheck, leaving her bank account dangerously low when the rent was due -- a cycle that never seems to end.\n\n\"I'm always one step behind,\" said Shelton, her voice choking up. \"It's a nightmare, it's a freaking nightmare right now.\"\n\nThe United States is slogging through a housing affordability crisis that was decades in the making. At the root of this problem: America failed to build enough homes for its growing population. The shortage strikes at the heart of the American dream of homeownership -- dampening President Joe Biden's assurances that the U.S. economy is strong and underscoring the degree to which Republican Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive GOP nominee for 2024, has largely overlooked the shortage.\n\nThe lack of housing has caused a record number of renters to devote an excessive amount of income to housing, according to a Harvard University analysis. Not enough homes are for sale or being built, keeping prices elevated. Average mortgage rates have more than doubled and further worsened affordability.\n\nIn fact, the Census Bureau reported that homeownership fell slightly at the end of last year in an otherwise solid economy. If it wasn't for shelter costs, inflation -- Biden's most pronounced economic problem -- would be running at a healthy and stable 1.8%. Instead, it's hovering around 3.2%.\n\nAdministration officials are confident that shelter inflation will soon cool, but the damage across several years is apparent to advocates and economists.\n\n\"I've been doing housing work for 30 years -- the housing affordability challenge is the worst I've ever seen in my career,\" said Shaun Donovan, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama years who now leads the nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners.\n\nDonovan noted that this is an increasingly bipartisan challenge that could bring the political parties together. Expensive housing was once the domain of Democratic areas such as New York City and San Francisco. It's now moved into Republican states as places such as Boise, Idaho, grapple with higher prices.\n\n\"It is a first-tier issue almost everywhere,\" he said. \"And that is changing the national politics around it in a way that I think is quite different than I've ever seen.\"\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that the outcome of the November election could ultimately depend on the path of 30-year mortgage rates.\n\nRates currently average about 6.74%. If they dropped closer to 6%, the odds of a Biden victory would increase. But rates moving near 8% might enable Trump to prevail, Zandi said.\n\n\"Given the current housing affordability crisis, higher rates will make owning a home completely out of reach for nearly all potential first-time homebuyers,\" he said. \"Since homeownership is a key part of the American dream, if it appears unattainable, this will deeply impact voters' sense of the economy.\"\n\nBiden, a Democrat, acknowledged the pain many are feeling in his State of the Union address earlier this month and in his budget proposal released on Monday.\n\nThe president wants to fund the building and preservation of 2 million housing units -- a meaningful sum, but not enough to solve the shortage. He also proposed a tax credit worth up to $10,000 to homebuyers. Over the past three years, he has increased rental assistance to 100,000 households.\n\n\"The bottom line is we have to build, build, build,\" Biden said Monday in a speech to the National League of Cities. \"That's how we bring down housing costs for good.\"\n\nRapidly climbing home prices were also a festering problem under Trump, who first achieved celebrity status as a real estate developer. While president, Trump called for limiting construction in the suburbs. He claimed during the 2020 election that Biden's policies to spur building and affordability would \"destroy your neighborhood.\"\n\nDuring the 2018 to 2020 years of Trump's presidency, the country's housing shortage surged 52% to 3.8 million units, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac.\n\nThe Associated Press contacted Trump's campaign for his policy plans but did not get a response. The America First Policy Institute, a think tank promoting Trump's vision, said the key is to cut government borrowing to reduce mortgage rates. The former president has pledged to reduce deficits, but an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible\n\nFederal Budget shows that his policies in office will have likely added more than $8 trillion to the national debt.\n\n\"The best way for us to improve access to homeownership for young people is to get interest rates back down, not to provide subsidies that cause housing unaffordability to worsen,\" said Mike Faulkender, chief economist at the institute.\n\nLower rates might play well with voters, but most economists say they would at best offer temporary financial relief. Purchase prices would likely adjust upward in response to greater demand from falling rates.\n\nConstruction, the more enduring solution, would take years to achieve and require new rules by states and cities. The administration is trying to incentivize zoning changes, but the major choices are outside the White House's control.\n\n\"Even as incomes are going up and the economy is doing well and inflation is coming down, people can't buy homes,\" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the brokerage Redfin. \"That's like the biggest problem for Biden because it's not one that he can solve.\"\n\nThe general rule of thumb is that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on rent or a mortgage. A typical household looking to buy a home would have to devote 41% of its income to mortgage payments, according to Redfin.\n\nThere are far-reaching economic risks because of this. High housing costs can lead people to cut back spending elsewhere. Advocates said it enables landlords to neglect their properties since there is always a ready tenant.\n\nEvictions can worsen health and educational outcomes for children and exact an even wider cost on society, said Zach Neumann, a Denver-based lawyer who provides more than $30 million annually in rental assistance through the nonprofit Community Economic Defense Project.\n\nThe cumulative costs of evicting poorer renters are \"$20,000 to $30,000 a year when you include shelter nights and emergency room visits,\" Neumann said. \"It's really overwhelming when you think about the total numbers and these folks are fighting to have a roof over their heads.\"\n\nWhile there is bipartisan agreement on the need for more housing, there has yet to be a significant plan that has passed the House and Senate. Biden has proposed housing aid throughout his administration that never materialized.\n\n\"Had Congress passed some of the investments that the president has called for since the beginning of the administration, had they done that three years ago, as he was advocating, we'd have affordable units coming online right now,\" said Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council.\n\nBut Mark Calabria, who was director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency during the Trump administration, said that many of the federal tools to increase housing such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit could further push up demand without adding enough construction.\n\n\"My worry would be we've done a number of things that increased demand when the problem is supply,\" said Calabria, now an adviser with the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nBut for renters such as Lori Shelton in Colorado, the debate about how to add housing supply is cold comfort when she owes rent now. She's previously dealt with the threat of eviction and late fees. She gets some rent money from her son, but she has also relied at times on her church to cover the $2,399 a month.\n\n\"I don't think the majority of us have that savings account,\" she said. \"If you spend that much on your rent and your groceries and your car and your bills, you don't have much for a fallback.\"",

          "title": "Why are so many voters frustrated by the US economy? It's home prices",
          "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lori Shelton can't fathom ever having the money to buy a home -- and that's a major reason why so many voters feel down on the economy ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nShelton, 67, drives an Uber to help pay rent in Aurora, Colorado. An advance on her pay covered her apartment's security deposit. But it also cut into her next paycheck, leaving her bank account dangerously low when the rent was due -- a cycle that never seems to end.\n\n\"I'm always one step behind,\" said Shelton, her voice choking up. \"It's a nightmare, it's a freaking nightmare right now.\"\n\nThe United States is slogging through a housing affordability crisis that was decades in the making. At the root of this problem: America failed to build enough homes for its growing population. The shortage strikes at the heart of the American dream of homeownership -- dampening President Joe Biden's assurances that the U.S. economy is strong and underscoring the degree to which Republican Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive GOP nominee for 2024, has largely overlooked the shortage.\n\nThe lack of housing has caused a record number of renters to devote an excessive amount of income to housing, according to a Harvard University analysis. Not enough homes are for sale or being built, keeping prices elevated. Average mortgage rates have more than doubled and further worsened affordability.\n\nIn fact, the Census Bureau reported that homeownership fell slightly at the end of last year in an otherwise solid economy. If it wasn't for shelter costs, inflation -- Biden's most pronounced economic problem -- would be running at a healthy and stable 1.8%. Instead, it's hovering around 3.2%.\n\nAdministration officials are confident that shelter inflation will soon cool, but the damage across several years is apparent to advocates and economists.\n\n\"I've been doing housing work for 30 years -- the housing affordability challenge is the worst I've ever seen in my career,\" said Shaun Donovan, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama years who now leads the nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners.\n\nDonovan noted that this is an increasingly bipartisan challenge that could bring the political parties together. Expensive housing was once the domain of Democratic areas such as New York City and San Francisco. It's now moved into Republican states as places such as Boise, Idaho, grapple with higher prices.\n\n\"It is a first-tier issue almost everywhere,\" he said. \"And that is changing the national politics around it in a way that I think is quite different than I've ever seen.\"\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that the outcome of the November election could ultimately depend on the path of 30-year mortgage rates.\n\nRates currently average about 6.74%. If they dropped closer to 6%, the odds of a Biden victory would increase. But rates moving near 8% might enable Trump to prevail, Zandi said.\n\n\"Given the current housing affordability crisis, higher rates will make owning a home completely out of reach for nearly all potential first-time homebuyers,\" he said. \"Since homeownership is a key part of the American dream, if it appears unattainable, this will deeply impact voters' sense of the economy.\"\n\nBiden, a Democrat, acknowledged the pain many are feeling in his State of the Union address earlier this month and in his budget proposal released on Monday.\n\nThe president wants to fund the building and preservation of 2 million housing units -- a meaningful sum, but not enough to solve the shortage. He also proposed a tax credit worth up to $10,000 to homebuyers. Over the past three years, he has increased rental assistance to 100,000 households.\n\n\"The bottom line is we have to build, build, build,\" Biden said Monday in a speech to the National League of Cities. \"That's how we bring down housing costs for good.\"\n\nRapidly climbing home prices were also a festering problem under Trump, who first achieved celebrity status as a real estate developer. While president, Trump called for limiting construction in the suburbs. He claimed during the 2020 election that Biden's policies to spur building and affordability would \"destroy your neighborhood.\"\n\nDuring the 2018 to 2020 years of Trump's presidency, the country's housing shortage surged 52% to 3.8 million units, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac.\n\nThe Associated Press contacted Trump's campaign for his policy plans but did not get a response. The America First Policy Institute, a think tank promoting Trump's vision, said the key is to cut government borrowing to reduce mortgage rates. The former president has pledged to reduce deficits, but an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget shows that his policies in office will have likely added more than $8 trillion to the national debt.\n\n\"The best way for us to improve access to homeownership for young people is to get interest rates back down, not to provide subsidies that cause housing unaffordability to worsen,\" said Mike Faulkender, chief economist at the institute.\n\nLower rates might play well with voters, but most economists say they would at best offer temporary financial relief. Purchase prices would likely adjust upward in response to greater demand from falling rates.\n\nConstruction, the more enduring solution, would take years to achieve and require new rules by states and cities. The administration is trying to incentivize zoning changes, but the major choices are outside the White House's control.\n\n\"Even as incomes are going up and the economy is doing well and inflation is coming down, people can't buy homes,\" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the brokerage Redfin. \"That's like the biggest problem for Biden because it's not one that he can solve.\"\n\nThe general rule of thumb is that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on rent or a mortgage. A typical household looking to buy a home would have to devote 41% of its income to mortgage payments, according to Redfin.\n\nThere are far-reaching economic risks because of this. High housing costs can lead people to cut back spending elsewhere. Advocates said it enables landlords to neglect their properties since there is always a ready tenant.\n\nEvictions can worsen health and educational outcomes for children and exact an even wider cost on society, said Zach Neumann, a Denver-based lawyer who provides more than $30 million annually in rental assistance through the nonprofit Community Economic Defense Project.\n\nThe cumulative costs of evicting poorer renters are \"$20,000 to $30,000 a year when you include shelter nights and emergency room visits,\" Neumann said. \"It's really overwhelming when you think about the total numbers and these folks are fighting to have a roof over their heads.\"\n\nWhile there is bipartisan agreement on the need for more housing, there has yet to be a significant plan that has passed the House and Senate. Biden has proposed housing aid throughout his administration that never materialized.\n\n\"Had Congress passed some of the investments that the president has called for since the beginning of the administration, had they done that three years ago, as he was advocating, we'd have affordable units coming online right now,\" said Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council.\n\nBut Mark Calabria, who was director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency during the Trump administration, said that many of the federal tools to increase housing such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit could further push up demand without adding enough construction.\n\n\"My worry would be we've done a number of things that increased demand when the problem is supply,\" said Calabria, now an adviser with the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nBut for renters such as Lori Shelton in Colorado, the debate about how to add housing supply is cold comfort when she owes rent now. She's previously dealt with the threat of eviction and late fees. She gets some rent money from her son, but she has also relied at times on her church to cover the $2,399 a month.\n\n\"I don't think the majority of us have that savings account,\" she said. \"If you spend that much on your rent and your groceries and your car and your bills, you don't have much for a fallback.\"",

        "body": "GAYLESVILLE - Cherokee County High School softball sophomore pitcher Emma Hill had a tough off-season. She injured her back last year and had to shut down her pitching during the summer for eight months to give it a much-needed rest.\n\nHill had quite the comeback at White Plains in early March - her first outing in the circle since her back problem. She tossed an 11-inning marathon with 20 strikeouts in a one-run Lady Warrior victory.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Hill was handed the ball in another clutch game: the Cherokee Invitational championship against area rival Etowah.\n\nThe Lady Warriors didn't need Hill to log quite as many innings as she did against White Plains, but she was just as dominant.\n\nHill struck out the first seven Lady Blue Devils she faced. She allowed just one hit on a bunt single by Maggy Bennett in the bottom of the fourth inning and a walk to pinch hitter Alyssa Scissum in the fifth. Hill finished with 12 strikeouts in the Lady Warriors' 10-0 victory in five innings.\n\n\"I'm trying to work my way back into how I was last season and trying to build off of that,\" Hill said. \"I couldn't pitch for about eight months, which was hard, but I gave it enough time to rest.\"\n\nAnd that's been bad news for the Lady Warriors' opponents so far this season when she's been inside the circle.\n\n\"When Emma is on she's on,\" Lady Warrior head coach Brad Weaver said. \"She doesn't have many bad days. Today was one of her really good days.\"\n\nIt was also one of the Lady Warriors' really good days.\n\nAfter losing at home in pool play to Glencoe on Friday 4-2, Cherokee County swept through Saturday's single-elimination bracket at Gaylesville. The Lady Warriors opened the day with a 9-0 win over Spring Garden in a rematch of last week's Cherokee County Tournament championship game, also won by the Lady Warriors 4-2.\n\nThe win over Spring Garden on Saturday set up a semifinal showdown with Valley Head - a 1-0 winner in 10 innings over Cedar Bluff. The Lady Warriors cruised to a 14-2 victory in that contest to clinch a spot in the championship game against Etowah.\n\nEtowah defeated Sand Rock in the other tournament semifinal on Saturday 7-0.\n\nAgainst Etowah, Cherokee County batters collected 10 hits. The Lady Warriors scored a run in the top of the first inning, then put the game out of reach with four in the fourth and five in the fifth.\n\nSaturday was a far cry from the previous night's loss to Glencoe, Weaver said.\n\n\"Last night we were a different team. Our chemistry for some reason was thrown off,\" Weaver said. \"We haven't played like that this year. Maybe us playing like that opened our eyes up for today. That's what we talked to them about after the game last night. We've got to wash this and get it out of our system, find a little more leadership, find a little more urgency. Today they came around.\n\n\"The energy in the dugout and the energy on the field was different. When we've got the energy going we're really good.\"\n\nGetting that energy going was leadoff hitter Abby Lea. She led off the game with a single to right off Etowah starting pitcher Gabby Pyburn. Lea scored on a single to left by Anna Walker to give Hill all the run support she needed in the circle.\n\nLea finished the game going 3-for-3. She helped put the exclamation point on the Lady Warrior win with a three-run homer to center field in the top of the fifth.\n\n\"Going into the game, we'd never seen their pitcher. It was a little something new,\" Lea said. \"We adjusted pretty well. We had a good many hits off of her. We scored early, and then Emma came in and shut them down.\n\n\"I just knew going up there (to the plate) I was looking for one pitch and one pitch only (inside). When I saw it I was going to hit it pretty hard. That's just what happened.\"\n\nWeaver said Lea is in the Lady Warrior leadoff spot for a reason.\n\n\"She sets the tone for us leading off. When she starts off hot, the rest of the lineup gets in there with her. She knows the pressure is on her, but she does well with it,\" Weaver said.\n\nAnd just like Weaver said, the Lady Warriors followed Lea's lead at the plate.\n\nLanie Williams went 2-for-3 with a triple and a walk. Raechel Russell and Bristol Bass both had a hit and a RBI apiece. Bass also scored a run.\n\nHill helped herself at the plate with a hit and a walk. Audrey Haygood had a hit and a run. Grayson Tucker tallied a walk and scored two runs. Macy Lea walked and scored a run. Emma Eberhart scored two runs.\n\n\"I think we definitely feed off of each other,\" Hill said. \"Once one of us does good, it just kind of goes down the line. We just keep going.\"\n\nThe two teams won't have long to wait for a rematch. They play each other in Attalla on Monday at 4:30 p.m.",

        "body": "DELAWARE, Ohio (WCMH) -- Cleanup efforts continued Saturday after an EF-1 tornado touched down in Delaware County Thursday. Since then, the Delaware County Emergency Management Agency has been working non-stop to assess the damage and provide resources to those in need.\n\nThe Delaware County EMA has been working with local fire departments and the Ohio EMA to assess the damage and figure out what the community needs. A lot of debris still needs to be picked up and the director for the Delaware County EMA said they're working on making that happen.\n\nBiggest tornadoes in Ohio of the past decade\n\n\"When you go out and see that much damage, it is very heart-wrenching,\" Alex McCarthy, director of the Delaware County EMA, said. \"That's why our office is trying our best to get out there and proactively get people in touch with some of these organizations who can come and help.\"\n\nAs the EMA was out surveying damage, one of the first things it noticed was high voltage transmission lines down throughout the area. McCarthy said it's important for them to be out in the community and help those in need.\n\n\"The bottom line is, as an emergency manager, whenever a disaster happens, we need to get a picture of how bad the damage is and what the scope of that is so that we can start coordinating response recovery efforts,\" he said.\n\nRon Brown's house was hit by the tornado. He said when he heard a storm was coming, he opened up his front door and looked outside.\n\nLakeview residents picking up the pieces after violent storms\n\n\"Before I could shut the door, my porch was gone and as I ran to the hallway, you could hear the roof just being peeled off,\" he said. \"Two minutes later, it was done.\"\n\nBrown said that the past couple of days has been a constant wave of emotions.\n\n\"You're very... you don't want to be selfish and cry and say, 'Oh, why me?' But the same side, you're your life, and I built this house with my dad in (19)84,\" he says, \"Fifty-eight years on this land. So the emotion, yeah, yeah. It's a hit in the gut.\"\n\nBrown said the community really has come together during this tough time and he's so appreciative for all the help.\n\n\"My neighbor across the street came over to check on me, to make sure I was mentally fine,\" Brown said. \"We've got a great community here. We got great people and yeah, we all have our up and down days. But you know, when you have that extra help, it makes it easier.\"\n\nMultiple dead after tornadoes, strong storms in central Ohio\n\nDespite what he's been through, Brown remains strong and keeps a positive attitude.\n\n\"We're alive,\" he said. \"We've got some broken stuff. We can replace that.\"\n\nThe Delaware County EMA asks anyone who needs to report storm damage to call either (740) 833-2137 or (740) 833-2138.",

It's a hit in the gut.\"\n\nBrown said the community really has come together during this tough time and he's so appreciative for all the help.\n\n\"My neighbor across the street came over to check on me, to make sure I was mentally fine,\" Brown said. \"We've got a great community here. We got great people and yeah, we all have our up and down days. But you know, when you have that extra help, it makes it easier.\"\n\nDespite what he's been through, Brown remains strong and keeps a positive attitude.\n\n\"We're alive,\" he said. \"We've got some broken stuff. We can replace that.\"\n\nThe Delaware County EMA asks anyone who needs to report storm damage to call either (740) 833-2137 or (740) 833-2138.",

PAUL, Minn. -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shut out in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United.",

He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shutout in three straight games.

(AP) -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shutout in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport",

        "body": "WASHINGTON, March 17, 2024 (BSS/AFP) - The United States shot down a drone fired by Yemen's Huthi rebels toward the Red Sea and destroyed more of their weaponry on Saturday, its military said.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that on Saturday morning the Huthis launched two drones towards the Red Sea, a commercially vital seaway that the Iranian-backed rebels have targeted dozens of times in the past four months.\n\nCENTCOM forces \"successfully engaged and destroyed one\" drone while the other is presumed to have crashed into the Red Sea, the statement said, adding that there were no reports of damage or injuries from ships in the area.\n\nThe statement came after the Huthis had earlier claimed a drone attack on a US destroyer in the Red Sea, adding that the strike \"achieved its goals.\"\n\nLater Saturday night, CENTCOM \"destroyed five unmanned surface vessels and one\" drone in Huthi-controlled areas of Yemen in \"self-defense,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe flurry of Huthi attacks, including a deadly assault on a bulk carrier last week and the sinking of a ship carrying thousands of tonnes of fertilizer, have triggered reprisal strikes by US and British forces.\n\nSuch exchanges have become a frequent occurrence in the area, sending shipping insurance costs soaring and prompting many firms to detour around the southern tip of Africa.\n\nThe Huthis say they are targeting Israel-linked shipping as part of an \"axis of resistance\" of Iran allies and proxies, in protest at Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

        "title": "Biden roasts Trump at Washington press dinner | News",
        "body": "WASHINGTON, March 17, 2024 (BSS/AFP) - US President Joe Biden joked about Donald Trump and his own age at an annual media dinner on Saturday -- before unloading deadly serious criticisms of his rival in November's election.\n\n\"One candidate's too old and mentally unfit to be president,\" the 81-year-old Democrat quipped at the Gridiron Club in Washington. \"The other guy's me.\"\n\nDemocrat Biden was making his first speech as president at the annual white tie gala for the US media and political elite, an event that Republican former president Trump addressed in 2018.\n\nBiden is trailing in a number of polls and faces voters concerns about his age, which he has tried to address by highlighting 77-year-old Trump's recent verbal slip-ups.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden took a swipe at Republicans in Congress who have launched an impeachment inquiry into his son's business dealings, saying they would \"rather fail at impeachment than succeed at anything else.\"\n\nHe added that Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, sitting at the head table with Biden on the eve of St. Patrick's Day \"took one look at Congress and he asked for another Guinness.\"\n\nVaradkar and Biden both pushed during a meeting at the White House on Friday for Republicans in Congress to stop blocking military aid for Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nBut Biden then returned to Trump, saying that the Democrats' election campaign would show how they rebuilt the US economy after the Covid-19 pandemic \"without encouraging the American people to inject bleach.\"\n\nHe was referring to an incident when Trump, as president, asked a top medical advisor whether virus victims could be injected with disinfectant to cure them.\n\n\"Look, I wish these were jokes, but they're not,\" added Biden.\n\n\"Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin's on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says, 'Do whatever the hell you want.'\"\n\nNoting that Estonia's Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, a strong critic of Russia, was also at his table, he added \"We will not bow down, they will not bow down and I will not bow down.\"\n\nBiden added that Trump's false claims to have won the 2020 election, and the January 6 2021 Capitol assault by pro-Trump rioters, showed there was \"poison coursing through the veins of our democracy.\"\n\nHe also backed journalists whom Trump has repeatedly attacked, adding: \"You are not the enemy of the people. You are a pillar of any free society.\"\n\nIn his own appearance at the Gridiron Club six years ago, Trump did trade unusually playful digs with the Washington press corps and also joked about North Korea and his own leadership style.\n\nThe Gridiron dinner -- held behind closed doors with no photos allowed -- sees Washington's elite unwind for a night of self-deprecatory humor which includes costumed members performing a song.",

        "body": "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shut out in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United.",

(AP) -- Robin Lod and Bongokuhle Hlongwane each scored a goal, and Minnesota United ended a seven-game winless streak against LAFC with a 2-0 victory on Saturday night in coach Eric Ramsay's debut for the Loons.\n\nRamsay was named Minnesota's head coach on Feb. 26. He joined the club after being the top assistant for Manchester United of the English Premier League.\n\nLod scored his right-footed shot to the top right corner of the net following a set piece in the 16th minute for Minnesota (3-0-1). Hlongwane fired his shot from just inside the center of the 18-yard box to the middle of the net in the 88th.\n\nLAFC (1-2-1) has been shutout in three straight games. Dénis Bouanga, the reigning Golden Boot winner, is still chasing his first goal of the season. Bouanga's shot from close range missed to the left in the 54th minute and his shot in the 65th was blocked. He also missed a shot early in the first half.\n\nDayne St. Claire saved two shots for Minnesota United. Hugo Lloris stopped one shot for LAFC.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sport",
