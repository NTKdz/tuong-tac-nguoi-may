        "body": "[ワシントン １５日 ロイター] - ロイター／イプソスの世論調査によると、「トランプ前米大統領は民主主義への脅威」とのバイデン大統領の訴えは、同氏の他の支持層に比べて黒人有権者にはあまり浸透していない。\n\nバイデン氏支持者の約５７％はトランプ氏の当選阻止が支持の理由と回答。積極的な支持を表明したのは３０％だった。大統領選で投票率を上げたい民主党にとって、トランプ氏の脅威に焦点を当てる戦略が一定の効果を上げている可能性を示している。\n\nただ、バイデン氏の支持基盤の約５分の１を占める黒人有権者は、トランプ氏を阻止するために投票すると回答した割合が３７％で、白人支持増の６５％を大きく下回った。\n\nとはいえ、バイデン氏は国内経済を支援し、中絶の権利を守るとのメッセージも掲げて選挙運動を展開。同氏を支持する黒人有権者の半数近くが政策を支持理由に挙げているのに対し、白人有権者では約３分の１にとどまっている。\n\nＲＯＫＫソリューションズのパートナーを務める民主党ストラテジストのロデル・モリノー氏は「トランプ氏の問題を強調することは確かに戦略の一部だが、有権者にバイデン大統領の実績を思い起こさせ、将来への前向きなビジョンを提供することも重要だ」と述べた。\n\nバイデン陣営の広報担当者サラフィナ・チティカ氏は、支持者はさまざまな問題に動機付けられているとの見方を示した。\n\n調査は７--１３日に国内の成人４０９４人を対象にオンラインで実施した。",

        "title": "Capital punishment: What are the realistic options on the table to cure the DC crime crisis? - Washington Examiner",
        "body": "Crime in Washington, D,C., is a crisis. Six months ago, the Washington Examiner looked at some of the issues plaguing the nation's capital. In the months since, things feel worse than ever, but that might be starting to change. In this series, we are looking at how the nation's capital wound up with its record on crime, how it affects its standing in the world, and what can be done to turn the problem around. In part five, the Washington Examiner takes a look at what local leaders have tried and what options are still on the table if anything is going to curb crime in the capital.\n\nAs crime in the District of Columbia has spiraled into a crisis, it has caused the local government to act, but some argue more options should be on the table.\n\nThe largest action the local government has taken occurred when Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the Secure D.C. Omnibus Amendment Act of 2024 into law. The bill, which passed the D.C. Council unanimously last week, is designed to continue the early trends indicating crime may be coming down from levels not seen since the late 1990s.\n\nThe new law combines 12 bills that increase penalties for gun offenses and retail theft, along with expanding the definition of carjacking, among other changes.\n\nSpeaking at the bill signing event on Monday, Bowser said that accountability is a major push with the new crime bill and that she is hopeful about recent trends showing emergency action taken at the end of 2023 may be working.\n\nCAPITAL PUNISHMENT: DC CRIME STATS IN EARLY 2024 COULD BE ON TRACK TO REBOUND AFTER DEADLY 2023\n\n\"We want the message to be very clear: If you are participating in those activities, we will hold you accountable,\" Bowser said. \"Our community has sent a very clear message. People are tired of crime and violence, and they want to count on accountability.\"\n\nAnother aspect of the crime bill deals with provisions seeking to help decrease crime in the D.C. Metro, which saw several shootings in 2023. The bill includes increased penalties for assaulting a Metro bus driver or rail operator, along with allowing police to issue civil citations for fare evasion.\n\nWhile district leaders have hailed the new bill as tangible progress in the battle to get crime under control, Jessica Anderson, president of the Sentinel Action Fund, thinks it may be \"too little too late.\"\n\nAnderson, in an interview with the Washington Examiner, said district leaders should be doing three things to fix the crisis: declaring that crime is real, fully restoring police funding, and establishing a \"full restoration of deterrence.\"\n\nWhile Bowser has argued accountability has been a key component of the crime bill effort, deterrence has to be top of mind for officials, Anderson said.\n\n\"There's got to be a clear sign from the D.C. leadership that criminals, if they commit a serious crime, they will go to jail,\" she said. \"It's not just kind of a slap on the wrist, but actually having consequences of their actions.\"\n\nShe criticized the crime bill for not going far enough, arguing that it appeared the council looked at the headlines rather than looking into instilling firm deterrence. Anderson did say it is not bad that the council passed the law, but that accountability needs to be had for letting crime spiral into a crisis.\n\n\"I think it's good that they did this. I'm not saying it's bad. I just think what's happened is that the damage of a soft-on-crime district has been felt,\" she said. \"It's been felt both by individuals, by lives lost, and by businesses that have been hurt over the last five years.\"\n\n\"Now they're trying to do something, but it's not enough. They need to have some accountability to what's happened, whether that's [district Attorney General] Brian Schwalb stepping down and taking responsibility for his lack of prosecuting juvenile crime or it's a full stop change to the D.C. Council's leadership team, but I don't think it's enough,\" she added.\n\nOn the matter of juvenile crime, which has plagued Washington in recent years, Anderson said that deterrence and education are the keys to reducing those crimes.\n\n\"So, you got kids that shouldn't be in school that are on the streets, and then you've got a lack of education about what happens when you enter into the criminal justice system,\" Anderson said. \"Kids don't realize that they could be prosecuted, that they may have to stand up for bail, that they could potentially face trial, they could potentially have jail time.\"\n\n\"There's a lack of juvenile awareness of how the criminal justice system should be working. So I think, one we need better education,\" she added.\n\nAnderson cited the \"lessons learned in the '90s\" as her guide for how the district can reduce juvenile crime, citing the D.A.R.E., or Drug Abuse Resistance Education, program as a key example of how to educate youth on the criminal justice system.\n\nGabriel Nadales, national director for the anti-crime group Our America, told the Washington Examiner while the bill is a \"step in the right direction,\" the District of Columbia still has work to do to increase its police force and resources to fight crime, echoing Anderson's call for a restoration.\n\nHe pointed to cuts the Metropolitan Police Department faced in the wake of the \"defund the police\" movement in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, in May 2020. The MPD has also had difficulty with shortages of officers as crime has spiked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile Washington has offered a $25,000 hiring bonus for police officers for the past 11 months, Nadales pointed to Florida's initiatives, which it has used to entice police officers to relocate to the Sunshine State. He argues that police officers being on the streets would help with the district's crime crisis.\n\n\"When you support police officers and you increase the number of police officers, you get lower crime,\" Nadales said.",

        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"",

Wie ihr die neusten Folgen direkt nach der US-Ausstrahlung auch in Deutschland streamt, erfahrt ihr bei Netzwelt.\n\nGrey's Anatomy\", die größte Krankenhausserie seit \"Emergency Room\", ist seit dem 14. März 2024 mit einer 20 Staffel zurück auf dem US-Sender ABC.\n\nNach dem dramatischen Cliffhanger der 19. Staffel warteten Fans gespannt auf den Start der neuen Folgen. In Deutschland zeigt der Free-TV-Sender ProSieben \"Grey's Anatomy\" in seinem Programm. Im Stream werden die neuen Folgen bei Joyn zum Abruf bereitgestellt. Zudem zeigte Streamingdienst Disney+ neue Folgen kurz nach der US-Ausstrahlung. Ein Startdatum für die 20. Staffel in Deutschland ist noch unbekannt. Wie ihr die Staffel trotzdem direkt nach US-Ausstrahlung sehen könnt, verraten wir hier.\n\nWer nicht bis zur deutschen Veröffentlichung der neuen \"Grey's Anatomy\"-Staffel warten will, kann mit einem VPN-Dienst die neuen Folgen direkt nach US-Ausstrahlung beim Streamingdienst Hulu sehen. Mit einem Trick lässt sich Hulu in Deutschland empfangen. Dafür muss ebenfalls die Ländersperre umgangen werden.\n\nWer ein wenig Geduld mitbringt, kann die neuen Folgen ab dem 28. März 2024 im Disney+-Programm aus Australien finden. Hier benötigt ihr einfach ein reguläres Disney+-Abo und einen VPN-Dienst, dann streamt ihr auch schon bald wöchentlich die neuen Episoden aus dem Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nAuch ohne VPN ist es möglich, die neuen Folgen von Staffel 20 direkt nach US-Ausstrahlung zu sehen - allerdings nur gegen einen Aufpreis. Die aktuellen Folgen können einige Tage nach US-Ausstrahlung bei Amazon käuflich erworben werden.\n\nWer noch etwas Geduld hat, sieht die neuen Folgen auch bei Disney+ und Joyn im Stream. Dort seht ihr die Folgen mit etwas Verzögerung, da dort jeweils eine Woche vor der ProSieben-Ausstrahlung eine neue Folge gezeigt wird.\n\nWann ProSieben Staffel 20 von \"Grey's Anatomy\" zeigt, ist noch unklar. In der Regel müssen wir etwa drei bis sechs Monate auf die Ausstrahlung im deutschen Fernsehen warten.",

(AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\n×\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "title": "Kids With Language Disorders Show Abnormal Brain Structure",
        "body": "WASHINGTON - A rigorous analysis of numerous studies concludes that a part of the brain traditionally associated with movement is abnormal in children with developmental language impairments, according to Georgetown University Medical Center neuroscientists. The discovery has the potential to improve both the diagnosis and treatment of the language difficulties.\n\nThe researchers investigated brain abnormalities in developmental language disorder. This condition, which impacts the development of various aspects of language, is about as common as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia, and more prevalent than autism. The scientists found that abnormalities occurred specifically in the anterior neostriatum within the basal ganglia, a structure found deep in the brain. They describe their findings in Nature Human Behaviour on March 15.\n\nTo better understand why the language impairments occur, the researchers analyzed the results of 22 articles examining brain structures in people with the disorder, and then employed a new computational method to identify common patterns of abnormalities across the studies. They determined that the anterior neostriatum was abnormal in 100% of the studies that examined the structure, with fewer abnormalities in all other parts of the brain.\n\n\"We hope that by identifying the neural bases of developmental language difficulties we may help increase awareness of a major, but also rather unrecognized, disorder,\" says the study's lead author Michael T. Ullman, PhD, professor of neuroscience and director of the Brain and Language Laboratory at Georgetown University Medical Center. \"We caution, however, that further research is necessary to understand exactly how the anterior neostriatum might lead to the language difficulties.\"\n\nUllman says the findings underscore the potential utility of drugs that are known to improve movement impairments due to basal ganglia dysfunction, such as those that act on dopamine receptors. Interventions that encourage compensation by intact brain structures may also be useful. Additionally, basal ganglia abnormalities could potentially serve as early biomarkers of an increased likelihood of developmental language problems. Such early warning signs could trigger further diagnostic procedures, potentially leading to early therapy.\n\n\"Continuing research efforts to further understand the neurobiology of developmental language disorder, especially the role of the basal ganglia, could help the many children who are affected by these problems,\" concludes Ullman.\n\n/Public Release.

But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"",

        "title": "Black voters less swayed by Biden's message that Trump threatens democracy, poll shows By Reuters",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Joe Biden's key campaign messages, that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is winning over fewer Black supporters and those without college degrees than other segments of his political base, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nWorries about political extremism and threats to democracy have emerged as among Americans' top concerns, following historic events including Republican former President Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Supreme Court's move to end the nationwide right to abortion and a surge in migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe online national poll of 4,094 respondents from March 7-13 showed Republicans and Democrats alike worry about America's democratic institutions and the prospect of highly partisan politicians pushing through policies most people don't want.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, a view that a majority of Republicans have adopted, and which Biden has warned could corrode voters' faith in the democratic process.\n\nSome 65% of poll respondents - including 72% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans - said they were worried \"partisan state legislatures will overturn the popular vote\" in some states to support a presidential candidate. Remaining respondents said they were not worried or didn't answer the question.\n\nEven higher shares of each party said they feared \"partisan-dominated governments enacting unpopular laws.\"\n\nAbout two in five Republicans and two in five Democrats consider the other party to be an imminent threat to the United States, according to the new poll.\n\nWhile the concerns were broadly held across different demographic groups, subtle differences in views within America's closely divided electorate highlight a concern among Democrats that some of Biden's supporters - notably those who are Black or without college degrees - might lack motivation to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSome 57% of Biden supporters in the poll said they were backing him to stop Trump, compared to 30% who cited support for Biden, suggesting the campaign focus on fear is helping allay Democrats' turnout concerns. Trump faces four criminal trials, including two tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nBut there were potential warning signs for Democrats.\n\nBiden's Black supporters, who make up about a fifth of his political base, were considerably less likely than his white backers to respond in the poll that they were voting to stop Trump, 37% to 65%.\n\nBlack Democrats were also less likely than white Democrats to say they were worried about a presidential candidate stealing an election or partisan state legislatures overturning its results. Black voters in the U.S. have skewed heavily Democratic for decades.\n\nAmong Biden supporters without college degrees, 53% said they wanted to stop Trump, compared to 64% of those with degrees.\n\nTo be sure, Biden is also campaigning on messages that he has helped the U.S. economy and pledges to defend abortion rights. Nearly half of Biden's Black supporters said they support him for his policies, compared to about a third of his white supporters.\n\n\"Highlighting the failures of Donald Trump is certainly part of that equation, but so is reminding voters of President Biden's accomplishments and providing a positive vision for the future,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who serves as partner at ROKK Solutions.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the campaign sees supporters motivated by a wide array of issues.\n\nIn a sign of America's broad concerns about government, some 72% of Democrats - including about the same share of Black Democrats - said they worried about unelected officials interpreting laws that affect their lives.\n\nAn even larger share of Republicans - 78% - shared that worry, which has been a key plank in Trump's campaign message that a \"deep state\" of unelected bureaucrats is ignoring the will of the people.\n\nVoters of all stripes said crime was an important issue in the coming election, including 84% of Democrats and 91% of Republicans. Similar shares cited the economy as important.\n\nDemocrats were much more likely than Republicans - 86% to 61% - to cite as important the growing gap between wealthy and average Americans. A similar share of Democrats said climate change was an important issue, but only about 40% of Republicans shared that view.\n\nClose to nine in 10 Democrats in the poll said protecting abortion access in their state was an important issue, compared to roughly half of Republicans.\n\nSome 81% of Republicans in the poll selected \"immigration making life harder for native-born Americans\" as an important issue, compared to 41% of Democrats.\n\nTrump has campaigned with a message that he will increase deportations of immigrants without legal standing.\n\nThe issue was considered important by about half of Democratic respondents without a college degree, and by about half of Black and Hispanic Democrats, underscoring Biden's potential vulnerability on immigration.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online with a nationally-representative sample of 4,094 U.S. adults, and had a margin of error of 1.7%.",

        "body": "New York 15.03.2024 - Der weltweite Markt für Batterien und damit für Elektroautos ist nach den neuesten Daten von Adamas Intelligence auch 2023 massiv gewachsen. Das nächste Fahrzeug von Tesla dürfte später relevant werden als bisher erwartet.\n\nWie Medien unter Berufung auf Daten von Adamas Intelligence berichten, wurden im vergangenen Jahr Batterien mit einer Gesamtkapazität von 689,2 GWh in Fahrzeugen auf den Markt gebracht. Im Vergleich zum Jahr 2022 ist das ein Plus von 40 Prozent.\n\nDie Daten umfassen sowohl Batterien für reine Elektrofahrzeuge als auch für Hybrid- und Plug-in-Hybridfahrzeuge. Beeindruckend ist der Vergleich mit dem Jahr 2020, als Batterien mit einer Gesamtkapazität von nur 134,5 GWh auf den Markt kamen. Adamas Intelligence weist darauf hin, dass im vergangenen Jahr 37 Prozent aller jemals produzierten Batterien in Fahrzeugen verbaut wurden.\n\nDie meisten Batterien wurden in Teslas verbaut. Auf den US-Hersteller entfielen 132,1 GWh, ein Zuwachs von 37 Prozent gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Bei BYD wurden Batterien mit einer Gesamtkapazität von 101,6 GWh verbaut, ein Plus von 51 Prozent. Der chinesische Anbieter GAC Aion verbaute Batterien mit einer Gesamtkapazität von 31,1 GWh, ein Plus von 75 Prozent.\n\nBei Volkswagen waren es 30,3 GWh, ein Plus von 21 Prozent, bei BMW 29,1 GWh, 76 Prozent mehr als 2022.\n\nTesla Model 2 wird laut Analysten erst später relevant\n\nIn der Modellpalette von Tesla fehlt nach wie vor ein Einstiegsmodell, das die Elektrifizierung des Individualverkehrs wirklich demokratisieren könnte. Das Model 2 gilt als ein solches Modell, das zu einem Preis von 25.000 US-Dollar auf den Markt kommen soll.\n\nDie Investoren von Tesla erhoffen sich von einem solchen Fahrzeug eine neue Wachstumsdynamik. Dies ist auch nötig, da CEO Elon Musk für das laufende Jahr ein eher moderates Wachstum erwartet. Gleichzeitig hat Tesla mit dem Ausbau des Werks in Grünheide und dem Bau der Produktionsstätte in Mexiko große Pläne und schafft Platz für die Produktion großer Stückzahlen weiterer Fahrzeuge.\n\nBei Evercore geht man derweil davon aus, dass das Model 2 erst 2027 in nennenswerten Stückzahlen auf den Markt kommen dürfte. Wie Bloomberg berichtet, gehen die Analysten um Chris McNally davon aus, dass der Produktionsstart zwar bereits Ende 2025 erfolgen könnte. Das Ziel von einer Million Einheiten im Jahr 2026 hält der Analyst aber nicht für realistisch. Vielmehr sei mit einer Produktionsrate von 500.000 Einheiten pro Jahr zu rechnen. Die Produktionssteigerung auf eine Million Einheiten sei dann für 2027 zu erwarten.\n\nCEO Elon Musk besuchte kürzlich die Gigafactory in Brandenburg und kündigte an, dass auch das Model 2 in Grünheide produziert werden soll. Auch die Produktion des Tesla Semi in Grünheide sei \"sinnvoll\", so Musk.\n\nDie Entwicklung auf den Rohstoffmärkten bleibt stark. Mehrere Faktoren führen zu einer Verknappung von Metallen und anderen Elementen, die für den Umbau der Energieinfrastruktur, aber auch des Individualverkehrs benötigt werden. Unternehmen wie Tesla, Volkswagen, Ford und General Motors investieren zweistellige Milliardenbeträge in den Umbau ihrer Unternehmen und den Aufbau von Produktionskapazitäten für Batterien und E-Komponenten.\n\nBegünstigt wird dieser Trend durch eine großzügige Förderpolitik in vielen Ländern. In den USA sollen in den nächsten Jahren fünf Milliarden Dollar in den Aufbau eines Ladenetzes für E-Autos fließen, Milliarden sind für den Aufbau einer eigenen Zulieferkette eingeplant. In Deutschland wird der Verkauf von E-Autos und Wallboxen gefördert und in Norwegen hat die Subventionspolitik dazu geführt, dass kaum noch Verbrenner gekauft werden.\n\nFür Batteriehersteller ist es daher wichtig, die Effizienz der verwendeten Kathoden zu steigern. Die Nano One Materials Corp. (WKN: A14QDY) hat ein patentiertes Verfahren zur kostengünstigen Herstellung von hochleistungsfähigen Kathodenmaterialien für Lithium-Ionen-Batterien entwickelt. Die so hergestellten Kathoden können in Elektroautos, Energiespeichern aber auch in elektronischen Geräten eingesetzt werden. Nano One Materials Corp. hat insgesamt 16 Patente in den USA, Kanada, China, Japan, Korea und Taiwan erhalten, darunter ein langlebiges und kobaltfreies Batteriematerial. Eine Reihe von Automobilherstellern zeigt bereits großes Interesse an den Entwicklungen von Nano One Materials.\n\nAuch die Zahl der Kooperationspartner wächst weiter. Heute sind es bereits zehn Automobilhersteller, Batterielieferanten, aber auch Bergbauunternehmen. Die Zahl der Mitarbeiter sei auf über 60 gestiegen, die Produktionsanlagen seien verdreifacht worden. Das Unternehmen betonte zudem, dass es in Bezug auf den ökologischen Fußabdruck branchenführend sei und dazu beitrage, die CO2-, Wasser- und Umweltbelastung in der Batterieproduktion zu reduzieren. Die One-Pot-Plattform-Technologie ermögliche die Herstellung von kostengünstigeren NMC-, LFP- und LNMO-Kathoden. Bloomberg New Energy Finance geht davon aus, dass der Markt für Lithium-Ionen-Batterien bis 2035 auf 4.800 GWh wachsen wird. Davon sollen 22 Prozent auf LFP-Kathoden und 16 Prozent auf LNMO-Kathoden entfallen. Die vollständige Pressemitteilung finden Sie hier: https://bit.ly/3smPlnD\n\nNano One hat ein Update zur Planung für das Jahr 2024 veröffentlicht. Darin verweist CEO Dan Blondal zunächst auf die starke Entwicklung im vergangenen Jahr und verrät, welche strategischen Ziele in diesem Jahr verfolgt werden.\n\nDas Jahr 2023 war für Nano One unter anderem geprägt durch den Erhalt von Fördermitteln in Höhe von 10 Mio. CAD am 13. Februar 2023. Die Fördermittel stammen von Sustainable Development Technology Canada (\"SDTC\"). Die Mittel werden für den Umbau der Anlage in Candiac verwendet. Darüber hinaus hat das Unternehmen Kommerzialisierungspläne für LFP und andere Materialien entwickelt.\n\nIm Juni 2023 wurde ein gemeinsamer Entwicklungsvertrag mit Our Next Energy zur Stärkung der nordamerikanischen Lieferketten für LFP unterzeichnet. Ziel der Zusammenarbeit ist die Qualifizierung und Validierung von LFP-Kathodenmaterialien für einen verbindlichen Abnahmevertrag.\n\nEin weiterer Meilenstein im Jahr 2023 war die im Oktober bekannt gegebene strategische Beteiligung des japanischen Konzerns Sumitomo Metal Mining in Höhe von 16,9 Mio. CAD. Nano One und Sumitomo Metal Mining haben zudem einen Kooperationsvertrag abgeschlossen, um die kommerzielle Produktion von LFP, CAM und nickelreichen CAM-Chemie zu beschleunigen.\n\nIm neuen Jahr sieht das Unternehmen wichtige Katalysatoren für die Unternehmensentwicklung in Fortschritten bei strategischen Partnerschaften in den USA und Kanada. Über diese sollen kleine, aber dennoch signifikante LFP-Verkäufe für die Anlage in Candiac initiiert werden. In der Folge soll ein Portfolio von Abnahmeverträgen aufgebaut werden, um die zukünftige Kapazität auslasten zu können.\n\nEine Machbarkeitsstudie wird im Hinblick auf die Eröffnung der ersten LFP-Anlage durchgeführt. Außerdem sollen die \"Design-Once-Build-Many\"-Initiativen ausgeweitet werden. Mit Behörden und Finanzpartnern sollen Verträge für eine erste Anlage und Wachstumspläne ausgearbeitet werden. Im Rahmen der Geschäftsentwicklung ist ein Engagement in den Bereichen Energiespeicherlösungen und Automobilproduktion geplant.\n\nCEO Dan Blondal bedankte sich bei den Aktionären und sagte, dass 2024 ein weiteres Jahr des Wandels sein wird, in dem \"die langfristige Wertschöpfung für die Aktionäre und die Aussichten auf Produktion, Wachstum, Lizenzen und Umsätze immer mehr in den Blickpunkt rücken werden\".\n\nDie vollständige Pressemitteilung finden Sie hier: https://bit.ly/4bB0oOC\n\nAm 21. Februar meldete Nano One den Erhalt von vier Patenten in Asien, womit sich das Patentportfolio auf 40 erhöht. Weitere 55 Patente sind angemeldet.\n\nDie jüngsten Erfolge umfassen Patente in Japan, Taiwan, China und Korea. Das Unternehmen erklärte, dass diese Erfolge die Tiefe und globale Relevanz des One-Pot-Verfahrens von Nano One zeigen.\n\nNano Ones CTO, Dr. Stephen Campbell, sagte, dass die neuen Patente die Qualität und Breite der Technologie demonstrieren, was besonders in Asien wichtig ist, wo das Unternehmen viele strategische Interessen hat.\n\nDie vollständige Pressemitteilung finden Sie hier: https://bit.ly/3ONpDn6\n\nNano One hat am 27. Februar den Beginn einer Machbarkeitsstudie für seine erste kommerzielle LFP-Produktionsanlage bekannt gegeben.\n\nDie Anlage soll eine Kapazität von 25.000 Tonnen pro Jahr haben. Ziel der Studie ist es, Abnahmeverträge von Kunden zu erhalten, um die Finanzierung des Projekts zu sichern. Die Studie wird von BBA durchgeführt, die über langjährige Erfahrung mit der Anlage in Candiac verfügt und bereits Erfahrungen mit der 200-Tonnen-Pilotanlage gesammelt hat. Das Design der Anlage soll als Blaupause für weitere Anlagen dienen. Nano One bezeichnet dies als \"Design-Once-Buld-Many\"-Wachstumsstrategie, die den Wert für die Aktionäre steigert und die Pläne für Lizenzvereinbarungen und Joint Ventures stärkt. Nano One teilte weiter mit, dass die Machbarkeitsstudie für die erste kommerzielle Anlage von entscheidender Bedeutung ist, da sie die Produktvalidierung und Abnahmeverträge ermöglicht, was für Nano One in diesem Jahr höchste Priorität hat.

(WKN: A14QDY) bietet in einer Zeit des Wandels eine Technologie, die diesen Wandel beschleunigen und ökonomisch wie ökologisch nachhaltiger gestalten soll. Das Unternehmen bewegt sich in einem Markt, der in wenigen Jahren ein Volumen von 23 Milliarden US-Dollar erreichen könnte. Die Knappheit der Rohstoffe für Batterien macht deutlich, wie wichtig es ist, Technologien zu entwickeln, die den Einsatz von Ressourcen optimieren. Die Bewertung von Nano One Materials liegt derzeit bei nur rund 320 Mio. CAD. Angesichts der immensen Bewertungen, die in diesem Sektor mittlerweile üblich zu sein scheinen, ist Nano One vergleichsweise günstig bewertet.\n\nHinweis:\n\nRedakteure und Mitarbeiter der Publikationen von PROFITEER/shareribs.com halten zum Zeitpunkt der Veröffentlichung keine Anteile an Wertpapieren, welche im Rahmen dieser Publikation besprochen werden.Die Redakteure und Mitarbeiter geben darüber hinaus bekannt, dass sie nicht die Absicht haben, Anteile der besprochenen Wertpapiere kurzfristig zu veräußern oder kurzfristig zu kaufen.\n\nPROFITEER/shareribs.com und seine Mitarbeiter werden für die Vorbereitung, die elektronische Verbreitung und Veröffentlichungen dieser Publikation sowie für andere Dienstleistungen entgeltlich entlohnt.

(AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "body": "Silver Spring. Die US-Arzneimittelbehörde FDA hat das erste Medikament zur Behandlung eine nicht-alkoholischen Fettleber (NASH) zugelassen. Der Wirkstoff Resmetirom kann laut Behördenmitteilung bei Patienten mit bereits mittelschwerer bis fortgeschrittener Leberfibrose eingesetzt werden. Hersteller ist das nordwestlich Philadelphias ansässige Unternehmen Madrigal Pharmaceuticals.\n\nResmetirom aktiviert den Angaben zufolge den Schilddrüsenhormonrezeptor-β, was die Ansammlung von Leberfett reduzieren soll. Patienten mit fortgeschrittener Fettleber hätten nun zusätzlich zu Ernährung und Bewegung erstmals auch eine medikamentöse Behandlungsoption, heißt es.\n\nSicherheit und Wirksamkeit des THR-β-Agonisten seien hinsichtlich des Surrogatendpunktes Leberentzündung und -vernarbung nach 12 Monaten einer auf 54 Monate angelegten RCT-Studie bewertet worden. Der Hersteller sei verpflichtet, die vollständigen Daten nach Abschluss der Studie einzureichen, um den Nutzen des Wirkstoffs zu verifizieren.\n\nWie es weiter heißt, hätten Leberbiopsien nach 12-monatiger Anwendung gezeigt, dass es bei 26 bis 27 Prozent der Probanden unter 80 mg Rezdiffra und 24 bis 36 Prozent unter 100 mg zu einem Rückgang der NASH und keiner Verschlimmerung der Vernarbungen gekommen sei; im Placebo-Arm sei dies nur bei neun bis 13 Prozent der Teilnehmer der Fall gewesen.\n\nMadrigal kündigte an, das Medikament sei voraussichtlich ab April erhältlich. Für bedürftige oder Patienten ohne Krankenversicherung werde ein Hilfsprogramm aufgelegt. Laut FDA leiden in den USA \"etwa 6-8 Millionen Menschen an NASH mit mittelschwerer bis fortgeschrittener Lebervernarbung\".\n\nResmetirom wird voraussichtlich auch in Europa vermarktet werden. Ein zentraler Zulassungsantrag ist bei der EU-Agentur EMA anhängig. Mit der Dossier-Begutachtung wurde ausweislich einer EMA-Übersicht Ende Februar begonnen. (cw)",

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) after it plunged into crisis and is in talks with other EU members who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement's human rights clause.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would discuss support for Ukraine, coordination on the war in the Middle East, and reaffirm their support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBiden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage and is fond of quoting Irish poets, visited Ireland last April to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his support for the peace deal.\n\nDuring the tour of Ireland, the longest ever by a sitting U.S. president, Biden visited his ancestral hometown, had a chance meeting with the priest who performed the last rites on his son Beau, addressed the Irish parliament and attended a state banquet at Dublin Castle.",

        "body": "FORT PIERCE -- Former President Donald Trump was greeted by a familiar sight Thursday when he arrived for his third appearance at hearings in the federal classified-documents case.\n\nAbout 70 people -- with flags, shirts and hats emblazoned with slogans supporting the presumptive Republican presidential nominee -- lined up along South Fifth Street behind the Alto Lee Adams Sr. U.S. Courthouse, hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nIt was an early start for some supporters, such as Bob Fix, of Loxahatchee.\n\n\"I got up at 3, hit the road at 6,\" Fix said. \"I ended up getting to Fort Pierce a little after 7.\"\n\nThe crowd included many of the same faces who have been at Trump's other court appearances in the Sunrise City, the first of which drew about 200 people in February. The second drew about 50 earlier this month.\n\n\"We've been with him since 2015,\" said Beau Slay, of Fort Pierce, general manager of Moonswiners Bar-B-Q. \"As long as he's fighting, we're fighting.\"\n\nA consistent presence at Trump events across the country since the 2016 campaign has been Maurice Symonette, of Miami, who leads the group Blacks for Trump.\n\n\"Black people are no longer blind,\" Symonette said. \"Blacks and whites must unite behind Trump.\"\n\nWhen Trump arrived at 9:30 a.m., he could be seen through the tinted window of his armored vehicle giving the crowd a thumbs-up and pumping his fist.\n\nJimmy Jackson, of Virginia, travels the country selling Trump merchandise at events like Thursday's. He was at the hearing here earlier this month, too.\n\nTensions mostly stayed low all morning until about 11:45 a.m., when an argument broke out between Trump supporters and someone speaking against Trump.\n\nLater in the afternoon, an altercation occurred that resulted in at least one arrest. Fort Pierce police spokesman Larry Croom said officers made an arrest about 1 p.m. after a minor scuffle between two men. There were no injuries, he said.\n\nCroom said he had not seen the report, so he could not comment on who was arrested.\n\nTrump left the courthouse at 2:50 p.m. and Orange Avenue was reopened to traffic at 3:10 p.m.\n\nTrump's appearance coincided with his attorneys asking U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon to throw out the 40 felony charges related to keeping and hiding documents with classified designations and alleged obstruction of justice. More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach more than a year after he left office, most under subpoena in June 2022 and during an FBI search in August 2022.\n\nThursday's hearing ended without a ruling from Cannon on the defense requests. Later that evening, Cannon issued a ruling denying one of the two arguments the defense made.\n\nOther defendants in the case are Walt Nauta, Trump's valet and bodyguard, and Carlos de Oliveira, property manager at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump also faces 44 charges in three other criminal cases, even after six charges were dismissed Wednesday in a state election-interference case in Georgia.\n\nTrump's legal team, and the prosecution led by Special Counsel Jack Smith, also are still awaiting word on a potential trial date. That date currently is May 20. However, Cannon appears set to push it back.\n\nSmith's team had asked for a July 8 date, while Trump's team wants trial to begin after the November presidential election. In a hearing earlier this month, Cannon called the prosecution's timeline \"unrealistic.\"\n\nTrump officially became the presumptive Republican nominee Tuesday after winning enough delegates to have a majority at the party's convention, July 15-18 in Milwaukee. President Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee also on Tuesday, in advance of the Democratic convention, Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nStaff writers Corey Arwood, Laurie K. Blandford, Melissa E. Holsman and Nick Slater contributed to this report.\n\nWicker Perlis is TCPalm's Watchdog Reporter for St. Lucie County.

        "title": "US lawmakers blocking critical funding for Haiti multinational mission By Reuters",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defense's contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.",

        "title": "Black voters less swayed by Biden's message that Trump threatens democracy, poll shows",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Joe Biden's key campaign messages, that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is winning over fewer Black supporters and those without college degrees than other segments of his political base, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nWorries about political extremism and threats to democracy have emerged as among Americans' top concerns, following historic events including Republican former President Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Supreme Court's move to end the nationwide right to abortion and a surge in migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe online national poll of 4,094 respondents from March 7-13 showed Republicans and Democrats alike worry about America's democratic institutions and the prospect of highly partisan politicians pushing through policies most people don't want.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, a view that a majority of Republicans have adopted, and which Biden has warned could corrode voters' faith in the democratic process.\n\nSome 65% of poll respondents - including 72% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans - said they were worried \"partisan state legislatures will overturn the popular vote\" in some states to support a presidential candidate. Remaining respondents said they were not worried or didn't answer the question.\n\nEven higher shares of each party said they feared \"partisan-dominated governments enacting unpopular laws.\"\n\nAbout two in five Republicans and two in five Democrats consider the other party to be an imminent threat to the United States, according to the new poll.\n\nWhile the concerns were broadly held across different demographic groups, subtle differences in views within America's closely divided electorate highlight a concern among Democrats that some of Biden's supporters - notably those who are Black or without college degrees - might lack motivation to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSome 57% of Biden supporters in the poll said they were backing him to stop Trump, compared to 30% who cited support for Biden, suggesting the campaign focus on fear is helping allay Democrats' turnout concerns. Trump faces four criminal trials, including two tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nBut there were potential warning signs for Democrats.\n\nBiden's Black supporters, who make up about a fifth of his political base, were considerably less likely than his white backers to respond in the poll that they were voting to stop Trump, 37% to 65%.\n\nBlack Democrats were also less likely than white Democrats to say they were worried about a presidential candidate stealing an election or partisan state legislatures overturning its results. Black voters in the U.S. have skewed heavily Democratic for decades.\n\nAmong Biden supporters without college degrees, 53% said they wanted to stop Trump, compared to 64% of those with degrees.\n\nTo be sure, Biden is also campaigning on messages that he has helped the U.S. economy and pledges to defend abortion rights. Nearly half of Biden's Black supporters said they support him for his policies, compared to about a third of his white supporters.\n\n\"Highlighting the failures of Donald Trump is certainly part of that equation, but so is reminding voters of President Biden's accomplishments and providing a positive vision for the future,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who serves as partner at ROKK Solutions.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the campaign sees supporters motivated by a wide array of issues.\n\nIn a sign of America's broad concerns about government, some 72% of Democrats - including about the same share of Black Democrats - said they worried about unelected officials interpreting laws that affect their lives.\n\nAn even larger share of Republicans - 78% - shared that worry, which has been a key plank in Trump's campaign message that a \"deep state\" of unelected bureaucrats is ignoring the will of the people.\n\nVoters of all stripes said crime was an important issue in the coming election, including 84% of Democrats and 91% of Republicans. Similar shares cited the economy as important.\n\nDemocrats were much more likely than Republicans - 86% to 61% - to cite as important the growing gap between wealthy and average Americans. A similar share of Democrats said climate change was an important issue, but only about 40% of Republicans shared that view.\n\nClose to nine in 10 Democrats in the poll said protecting abortion access in their state was an important issue, compared to roughly half of Republicans.\n\nSome 81% of Republicans in the poll selected \"immigration making life harder for native-born Americans\" as an important issue, compared to 41% of Democrats.\n\nTrump has campaigned with a message that he will increase deportations of immigrants without legal standing.\n\nThe issue was considered important by about half of Democratic respondents without a college degree, and by about half of Black and Hispanic Democrats, underscoring Biden's potential vulnerability on immigration.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online with a nationally-representative sample of 4,094 U.S. adults, and had a margin of error of 1.7%.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; additional reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Scott Malone, Deepa Babington and Lincoln Feast.)",

They have reached deals to re-sign long-snapper Trent Sieg and cornerback Jourdan Lewis.\n\nThe Cowboys have traditionally slow-played free agency, choosing to play on the edges rather than paying big money when it begins.\n\n\"I feel like we are able to cut and shoot,\" Jones said Thursday after announcing AT&T Stadium would host Kid Rock's Rock N Rodeo as a prelude to the PBR World Finals in May. \"Dak's been willing to work with us. We've had good discussions about him and his contract. He's all-in in working with us, and we've had personal discussions with Dak as well. Other than that, that's all we'll say about that, our negotiations with him. We want to keep that private. Won't get into timelines, but certainly a priority of ours.\"\n\nPrescott is entering the final year of his contract and is set to make $29 million in base salary with a $5 million roster bonus due Saturday. The Cowboys cannot place the franchise tag on him, based on a clause in his contract, and he also has a no-trade contract.\n\nLast week, Prescott expressed confidence in a new deal getting done.\n\nWhile that would provide the Cowboys ample room against the cap to make deals, it's likely they would continue with their same approach to free agency. They have not made a major free agent addition since signing cornerback Brandon Carr to a five-year, $50 million deal in 2012.\n\nWhile NFC East foes have made big moves, such as Saquon Barkley joining the Philadelphia Eagles; Brian Burns being traded to the New York Giants; and the Washington Commanders signing several free agents, including former Cowboys Dorance Armstrong and Tyler Biadasz; Jones is taking a big-picture view.\n\n\"There's a lot to be played out between now and our first game next year,\" Jones said. \"I don't think you win a Super Bowl championship on the first, second or third day of the league year.\"\n\nBut fans' frustration has been louder this offseason, especially with the Super Bowl drought at 28 years and counting after a 48-32 loss to the Green Bay Packers in the wild-card round of the playoffs.\n\n\"Everybody certainly has that right,\" Jones said. \"I know where the frustration is; it's the fact that we have not had a lot of success in the playoffs to their satisfaction. Until we do that, the criticism is certainly something that's going to be there ... but we are going to stick with what we believe will ultimately get us a championship for our fans. We don't define all-in by what you spend in free agency.\"\n\nThe addition of Kendricks fills a major need for the Cowboys, especially with Leighton Vander Esch not expected to continue playing. Last year, the Cowboys played a converted safety, Markquese Bell, at linebacker after Vander Esch was hurt.\n\nKendricks played seven seasons with the Minnesota Vikings under new Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer. Jones said Zimmer and run game coordinator Paul Guenther, who was a Vikings assistant, \"influenced us in a big way.\"\n\n\"I just think he'll be a great fit,\" Jones said of Kendricks. \"He'll walk right in and be one of the leaders on defense right away. He knows what Mike's trying to do on defense.\"\n\nJones did not close the door on the return of left tackle Tyron Smith. At the combine, it appeared unlikely he would return to the Cowboys for a 14th season, but he remains unsigned.\n\n\"Tyron Smith's going to be a Hall of Fame football player, and he's had an amazing career,\" Jones said. \"We've not shut the door on a continued career here in Dallas. ... He's one of the great left tackles to play the game.\"\n\nThe Cowboys also have a hole at running back after losing Tony Pollard in free agency to the Tennessee Titans. They did not get into heavy discussions for Derrick Henry, who signed with the Baltimore Ravens, or Aaron Jones, who signed with the Vikings.\n\nJones acknowledged the Cowboys \"don't have an established back in the organization right now,\" with just Deuce Vaughn, Malik Davis and Hunter Luepke getting carries last year. Pollard's backup, Rico Dowdle, is also a free agent.\n\nThe draft could be the way the Cowboys find their lead back for 2024.\n\n\"This is an organization that has been built on great backs, whether it's Tony Dorsett, Herschel Walker, Emmitt Smith, Ezekiel Elliott or Tony Pollard. We're big believers in backs. They bring a lot to the table,\" Jones said. \"Unfortunately, we're at a point where we have to make some decisions in terms of where we allocate dollars. ... We feel like there's going to be ways to address the running back situation in a more efficient way. We'll see how that works out.\"",

        "title": "Rory McIlroy shares lead at Players despite drama on 7th hole",
        "body": "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- Despite hitting two tee shots into the water and being at the center of a controversial drop after the second one, four-time major champion Rory McIlroy opened the 50th Players Championship with a 7-under 65 to grab a share of the first-round lead Thursday.\n\nMcIlroy, the 2019 Players Championship winner, was tied atop the leaderboard with Xander Schauffele and reigning U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, who had much more uneventful opening rounds at TPC Sawgrass.\n\nMcIlroy had just taken the lead at 8 under when he pulled his drive left on the par-4 seventh hole, his 16th of the round. McIlroy's ball crossed a hazard, bounced and kicked into the water.\n\nThe issue was whether his ball hit above a red hazard line on the slope of a fairway bunker or below it. If the ball hit above the red line, McIlroy was permitted to take a drop at that spot. If the ball hit below the line, however, he would have to go much farther back to drop and hit his third shot.\n\nFrom the tee, McIlroy was certain that he saw his ball hit above the red line. Norway's Viktor Hovland and Jordan Spieth, who were playing with McIlroy, didn't seem so sure.\n\nIt made for a rather uncomfortable moment in what was generally a comfortable round for McIlroy, who tied a Players Championship record with 10 birdies in a round.\n\n\"It would have been nice to shoot 62 and not hit two in the water,\" McIlroy said.\n\nCanada's Nick Taylor and England's Matt Fitzpatrick were 1 stroke behind at 6 under, while world No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, the defending Players Championship winner, was tied for sixth at 5 under, along with Jason Day, Ludvig Åberg and four others.\n\nPlay was suspended at 7:32 p.m. ET because of darkness with nine golfers still on the course, and the first round will resume at 8:50 a.m. Friday. The second round will begin as scheduled at 7:40 a.m.\n\n\"I knew the scores were going to be fairly low today,\" said Scheffler, who won last week's Arnold Palmer Invitational and is trying to become the first back-to-back winner at the Players Championship. \"The golf course is pretty soft, and we had unusually low winds, I'd say, for TPC Sawgrass, and the scores obviously reflected that.\"\n\nScheffler opened with a bogey on the par-4 first hole -- his only one of the round -- and then ran off three straight birdies. He picked up three more birdies on the back.\n\n\"You can't really force it around this place, like I've said a bunch of times, you really can't,\" Scheffler said. \"It was nice bouncing back after the rough start and just playing a really good round of golf.\"\n\nMcIlroy's contentious conversation with Hovland and Spieth on the seventh hole was the story of the day. After the round, McIlroy insisted that he saw his ball hit above the red hazard line. He ended up making a double bogey. McIlroy had a similar situation when he hit his tee shot into the water on No. 18, his ninth hole.\n\n\"It was just a matter of whether it was above the line or below, and I thought I saw it pitch above the line [on No. 7],\" McIlroy said. \"[No.] 18 was a pretty similar situation. Again, adamant it crossed, it's just a matter of where it crosses. I think this golf course more than any other, it sort of produces those situations a little bit.\"\n\nHovland and Spieth declined to comment after their rounds. Hovland made a double bogey on the last hole to card a 1-over 73; Spieth posted a 2-over 74 with four birdies and six bogeys.\n\nThe golfers' conversation on the seventh fairway lasted about 10 minutes before McIlroy took a drop.\n\n\"I think Jordan was just trying to make sure that I was doing the right thing,\" McIlroy said. \"I mean, I was pretty sure that my ball had crossed where I was sort of dropping it. It's so hard, right, because there was no TV evidence. I was adamant. But I think, again, he was just trying to make sure that I was going to do the right thing.\"\n\nAfter looking for his ball in the water and not finding it, McIlroy and his caddie, Harry Diamond, walked back to the spot where they believed his ball had landed.\n\nHovland walked across the fairway with his hand in his pockets and told McIlroy, \"We don't know for sure that it crossed the line.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty comfortable saying that it did -- that it landed above the red line,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"I thought it was really close,\" Hovland said. \"I can't say either way.\"\n\nThen Spieth walked across the fairway and chimed in. Members of the TV crew had apparently told him that McIlroy's ball hit below the line.\n\n\"Everyone that I'm hearing that had eyes on it, which is again not what matters, is saying they're 100 percent certain it landed below the line,\" Spieth said. \"That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nBy that time, a PGA Tour rules official had arrived. McIlroy asked him to check with the TV broadcast, but he was told there were no replays available. McIlroy took a drop and couldn't get up and down, settling for a double-bogey 6. He bounced back with a birdie on the par-5 ninth hole.\n\n\"I feel like I'm one of the most conscientious golfers out here, so if I feel like I've done something wrong, it'll play on my conscience for the rest of the tournament,\" McIlroy said. \"I'm a big believer in karma, and if you do something wrong, I feel like it's going to come around and bite you at some point.\n\n\"I obviously don't try to do anything wrong out there, and play by the rules and do the right thing. I feel like I obviously did that [on] those two drops.\"\n\nSchauffele's bogey-free round of 7-under 65 was much more uneventful. He started on the back nine and made the turn at 3 under 33. Then he posted birdies on Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and another one on the par-four fifth.\n\nSchauffele ran into trouble on the seventh hole after blocking his tee shot into the trees to the right. He was 163 yards from the hole and surrounded by limbs. His ball was sitting down and there was one opening-straight up.\n\nAfter telling his caddie, Austin Kaiser, that he could live with attempting a \"hero shot,\" Schauffele took a full swing and hit a high sweeping shot across a bunker and water. His ball landed in the fairway short of the green, and he chipped to 4 ½ feet and made par.\n\n\"It was over everything, but it was just like a window that was pretty high up,\" Schauffele said. \"I would not want to hit the shot again.\"\n\nThe highlight of the day was Ryan Fox's ace on the par-3 17th hole, after he had posted an eagle 3 on the par-5 16th. He became the first golfer in Players Championship history to card a 3-1 on Nos. 16 and 17, according to the PGA Tour. It was the 14th ace on the island-green 17th hole since the tournament moved to TPC Sawgrass in 1983.",

        "title": "Hard-throwing teens draw scouts, scholarships. More and more, they may also need Tommy John surgery",
        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nDavid Brandt, The Associated Press",

        "title": "Should county stay in the aging County-City Building? Commissioners weigh options.",
        "body": "SOUTH BEND -- St. Joseph County commissioners are starting a public conversation about whether county offices will remain in a 14-story downtown landmark that dates to 1967: the County-City Building.\n\nCarl Baxmeyer, the commissioners' president, cites leaks in the roof and in the basement tunnel, drafty windows, a heating and cooling system that's beyond its normal lifespan, and corroding galvanized pipes that burst twice last year.\n\nCommissioner Derek Dieter points to recent elevator repairs and how the public has to wait for elevators to reach the county health department and other commonly visited services.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the city of South Bend plans to vacate its three and a half floors and move into the current downtown headquarters of the South Bend Community School Corp. in 2025.\n\n\"We have to face it,\" Baxmeyer said of the county-owned structure.\n\nAt 6 p.m. March 19, after the regular commissioners meeting, which has been moved to 5 p.m. in the County-City Building, local consultants from DLZ and Abonmarche will give a public presentation to the commissioners on their assessment of the building's condition and what to do next.\n\nThe consultants will review the pros and cons and costs of options that include building a whole new structure, renovating the entire building, renovating only parts of the building and replacing key parts of its infrastructure.\n\nCommissioners will be looking for the public's feedback. But, ultimately, commissioners will also need the county council's support because it has to approve expenditures.\n\nBaxmeyer said it won't be physically or financially possible to abandon the building altogether. Part of that is because the County-City Building's utilities also serve three neighboring county courthouse buildings.\n\nIn fact, when a water main broke March 5 in the main courthouse, all three courthouses and the County-City Building closed for the day because, in order to make repairs, the water had to be shut down to all of them.\n\nAnd during a cold snap in January, the aging boiler couldn't maintain sufficient heat; so, commissioners closed the building and the courthouses for a few days.\n\nBaxmeyer also said that building a new home for county offices doesn't seem financially viable, adding that consultants estimate that it would cost well in excess of $100 million.\n\n\"We have other needs,\" he said of the county.\n\nDieter is convinced that the county needs to move out and find existing office space in downtown, adding, \"It doesn't make sense to put any more money into the building.\"\n\nBaxmeyer spoke more cautiously, saying he'd like to first see if the numbers show that to be the best approach. He also points out a need to consider what the needs are for the county's other buildings, where consultants are also studying options.\n\n\"I'm not ready to advocate for anything,\" he said. \"I want to look at the report and assess the needs.\"\n\nThey both say that the top complaint from employees and the public is the lack of nearby parking.\n\n\"We're going to have to make major investments one way or another,\" Baxmeyer said.\n\nDieter claims there's a backlog of maintenance and upgrades that should have been done on the County-City Building earlier.\n\nIn 2023, commissioners used almost $400,000 of federal pandemic American Rescue Plan money to renovate the building's lobby. But Dieter said that was before they realized the extent of mechanical issues throughout the structure and that officials might consider moving out.\n\nIf the county does move out, it would mean mothballing certain floors while other floors remain occupied. Dieter said, for example, that the county prosecutor's and clerk's offices would likely remain because they're so close to the courthouses. He suggested that the county could rent out some of the remaining vacant offices.\n\nIf the county moves out, Baxmeyer said, consultants so far are showing that the county could save money if it does repairs and minor renovations only to floors as needed -- that is, if they're occupied -- rather than to do a full-scale renovation of the sixth through 14 floors.\n\nThe offices with windows make up the sixth through 14th floors. Mechanicals are on the fifth floor. The city occupies the top three floors. And, apart from some city services that use half of the fourth floor, the county uses everything from the 11th floor down.\n\nThe county also has some services, including the Emergency Management Agency, in the Law Building across the street at 125 Lafayette Blvd. Dieter suggests selling that building if the county moves to another location.\n\nDieter said he was scoping out available buildings in downtown late last year and even took more than 20 people, including employees and most of the county council, for a tour of the large, vacant Crowe building and its expansive parking lot on the west bank of the St. Joseph River, just south of the Jefferson Boulevard bridge. He was impressed with it, but he said the council wasn't interested in providing earnest money so the county could negotiate. Since then, he said, a company affiliated with Holladay Properties has bought the Crowe building.\n\nOn Thursday, the city bought the neighboring River Glen Office Park, a series of buildings just to the south that Dieter also toured with officials.\n\nMarch 14, 2024: South Bend buys $3.25 million riverfront office park, eyes denser redevelopment\n\nWithout those locations, Dieter said, he's still looking for a good option with parking. He wants to keep at least the health department, treasurer's office and assessor's office all on the first floor to make them more accessible to the public.\n\nThe city of South Bend hopes to move into the current school headquarters building at 215 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., which it is buying, by late spring in 2025, a city spokeswoman said. And the South Bend Community School Corp. aims to be out of that building this summer.\n\nThe school district is moving its offices to the Brown Community Learning Center at 737 W. Beale St. to save on operating costs and make use of property that it already owns.\n\nThe city and the schools finalized the sale of the headquarters in 2022, with the city paying $2.8 million to purchase it and allocating another $5 million to support renovations.\n\nCity officials have said the move would give the city more space, consolidate its offices under one roof and make them more accessible to the public, while also saving money on operating costs.\n\nBut it also means that the county will have to pick up the County-City Building's costs that the city has covered.\n\nSouth Bend Tribune reporter Joseph Dits can be reached at 574-235-6158 or jdits@sbtinfo.com.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defense's contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.\n\n(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington and Aaron Ross in Nairobi; Editing by Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "body": "HOUSTON -- Two days after trading for running back Joe Mixon, the Houston Texans gave him a three-year, $27 million contract extension, including $13 million guaranteed, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Texans traded a 2024 seventh-round pick to the Cincinnati Bengals for Mixon after he was expected to be released when the Bengals reached a deal with free agent running back Zack Moss on Monday.\n\nThe Texans hope Mixon, who rushed for 1,034 yards and nine touchdowns, can bolster their 2023 rushing attack that ranked just 28th in yards per game (92.7).\n\nMixon said the trade was \"a shocker\" for him.\n\n\"I gotta say it was definitely shocking,\" Mixon said on Thursday. \"I took that 24 to 48 hours to hurt. It took a while and I'm still having emotional feelings about it. But that's the place where I can forever feel like that's home for me.\"\n\nThe former 2017 second-round pick spent seven seasons in Cincinnati and was a Pro Bowl selection in 2021. He was a member of the Bengals team that lost to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI.\n\nMixon, 27, rushed for 6,412 yards during his Bengals career, averaging 4.1 yards per carry and scoring 49 touchdowns. He also caught 283 passes for 2,139 yards and 14 TDs.\n\nHowever, Mixon is eager for the new start in Houston and hopes to bring similar success from Cincinnati.\n\n\"We bought the city of Cincinnati, we got it back lit again, and I plan on bringing that same thing here,\" Mixon said. \"[Texan] fans, I'm sure -- they got a taste of it last year, but I feel like with what we've got in the making, I think it's going to be a great thing. Like I said, I'm just excited to be here, feel wanted, and I just can't wait to make the most of my opportunity when my number is called.\"\n\nOne reason Mixon is enthusiastic about being in Houston is 2023 Offensive Rookie of the Year quarterback C.J. Stroud, who led the NFL in touchdown-to-interception ratio (23:5) and passed for 274 yards per game.\n\n\"Yeah, well, C.J. is a phenomenal player. Obviously, he was the Rookie of the Year, and that ain't by no fluke,\" Mixon said. \"... With the quarterback we've got in C.J., like I said, he's phenomenal, and I know for a fact he's going to make that next jump, and that's in terms of them playoff wins. But obviously we take them one game at a time.\"",

        "title": "Gilead CAR-T cancer therapy capacity to quadruple by 2026",
        "body": "FREDERICK, Maryland (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences will be able to quadruple production of its cell therapy cancer treatments by 2026 due to improvements in the U.S. biotech's manufacturing processes, an executive in charge of that business told Reuters.\n\nCindy Perettie, executive vice president of Gilead's Kite cell therapy unit, said these changes have already allowed the company to increase the number of patient treatments it can produce to 10,000 annually from 6,000 last year.\n\n\"We expect by 2026, with the same footprint - not changing anything or investing - we will be at capacity for 24,000 CAR-Ts per year,\" Perettie said on Thursday in an interview at a company manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nCell therapies like its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatments Yescarta and Tecartus are increasingly important to Gilead, which has been working for several years to build its presence in oncology and diversify outside of its core HIV business.\n\nGilead recently announced it reduced its median turnaround time to produce Yescarta to 14 days. Perettie said she expects the company will be able to shorten the turnaround time further this year.\n\nGilead paid nearly $12 billion in 2017 to buy Kite, one of the leading players in the emerging field of CAR-T therapies, which currently treat a variety of blood cancers. The company has said it expects oncology products to account for a third of its revenue by the end of the decade.\n\nCAR-T therapy involves removing a patients' own T cells - a key component of the immune system - engineering them to recognize and attack malignant cells, and re-infusing them.\n\nGilead, whose rivals in the field include Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis, is the market leader, according to Perettie.\n\nShe said the company expects to build its market share for Yescarta and Tecartus this year as it works to make the treatments available to more patients in more hospitals.\n\nGilead is expanding its network of health center sites across the U.S. where patients can receive the therapy, and \"doubling down\" on efforts to reach patients in its existing treatment sites in academic hospitals around the country, Perettie said.\n\nInitial growth will come from those academic hospitals, she said, adding that most of the growth from efforts to expand into more hospitals will not be seen until 2025.\n\nThe company expects to build the overall reach of CAR-T in the U.S. as well as its market share. More than 27,000 doses of the six approved CAR-T products have been administered in the U.S. since 2017.\n\nGilead's CAR-T revenue growth slowed recently, with sales dipping sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2023 to around $456 million for both treatments. Yescarta and Tecartus each costs more than $420,000 in the United States.\n\nThe company said last month that it expects first-quarter CAR-T sales to be flat or slightly up from the prior quarter, but that growth would pick up later this year.\n\nEarlier this week, researchers reported encouraging data from a small, ongoing study of a Gilead CAR-T therapy against recurrent glioblastoma, a deadly form a brain cancer.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Erman; editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)",

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) after it plunged into crisis and is in talks with other EU members who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement's human rights clause.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would discuss support for Ukraine, coordination on the war in the Middle East, and reaffirm their support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBiden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage and is fond of quoting Irish poets, visited Ireland last April to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his support for the peace deal.\n\nDuring the tour of Ireland, the longest ever by a sitting U.S. president, Biden visited his ancestral hometown, had a chance meeting with the priest who performed the last rites on his son Beau, addressed the Irish parliament and attended a state banquet at Dublin Castle.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington.

        "title": "House GOP looks to turn page on perception of chaotic leadership but float future changes - Conservative Angle",
        "body": "WEST SULPHUR SPRINGS, West Virginia -- An ousted speaker. An expelled member. A growing number of lawmakers leaving office before their term expires. The House has undergone a tumultuous year under Republican control -- but GOP leaders are still confident in their chances to grow their narrow majority.\n\nAs House Republicans gathered for their annual retreat at The Greenbrier resort in West Virginia this week, party leaders outlined their strategy to unify messaging and campaign priorities as they court voters. But the party has been plagued by infighting and lingering disagreements for months, leading to criticism from their Democratic colleagues that they are unfit to lead the lower chamber.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, argue their unruly dynamics are a model of how democracy is meant to work.\n\n\"Democracy is messy,\" Johnson said. \"Sometimes it's very messy. This is part of that process. But I think what you've seen is that even though we live in a time of divided government, and even though Republicans have quite literally almost the smallest majority in U.S. history, in an effort that some deem to be impossible, we are actually moving the ball forward and getting the job done. We are governing.\n\n\"While you might describe it as chaotic, the Republican-led majority has gotten a lot of really important substantive work done,\" Johnson said.\n\nDuring the two-day trip in West Virginia, Johnson sought to project a sense of unity even as he gave a forceful message to members urging them not to get involved in other incumbents' primaries, according to a source in the room. The message was met with applause from members in the room, who largely agreed with his message.\n\nStill, several of Johnson's most rebellious members were not in attendance at the annual retreat. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), for one, was campaigning with a Republican candidate challenging Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) in Texas in lieu of attending the conference.\n\nRoughly 100 GOP lawmakers attended the yearly issues retreat this week, a source familiar told the Washington Examiner. That is less than half the entire House GOP conference, which has 219 members.\n\nParty leaders brushed off concerns about the low attendance, noting several members are busy with campaign events as they face competitive races.\n\n\"It's a later conference retreat,\" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) said. \"It's in the midst of primaries in these districts. It's a lot of new members who feel the need to go home or are facing their current primaries as incumbents.\"\n\nStefanik also pushed back on the perception of disunity stemming from GOP members seeking to oust their fellow incumbents, noting primary challenges are not specific to the Republican Party.\n\nStill, House leaders acknowledged the lack of \"normal process\" in the House over the last several months -- hinting that some changes may be made should Republicans maintain their majority in the lower chamber.\n\n\"I just think it's something that a lot of members on both sides of the aisle talk about openly that they have a desire for a more normal process on the House floor again,\" Johnson said. \"We'll be looking at that on the House rules package in our respective caucus and conference packages as we go into the new Congress. And that's just something we should do in due course, be good stewards of the institution.\"\n\nAmong those possible rule changes is the threshold to vacate a sitting speaker. Under the current rules, any one member can propose a motion to remove the House speaker. That rule was agreed to by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in exchange for support for his speakership bid -- before being ousted by that mechanism just nine months later.\n\nThe House was upended into chaos last October after McCarthy's ouster, which marked the first time a sitting speaker was removed from the position and resulted in weeks of stalled progress as Republicans scrambled to elect a new leader, prompting some members to suggest a rule change to avoid repeating that fate.\n\n\"The motion to vacate is something that comes up a lot amongst members in discussion, and I expect it will probably be a change to that as well,\" Johnson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBut even amid the unpredictability under House Republicans, party leaders have expressed confidence they will not only hold on to their slim majority but that they will expand their narrow margins.\n\n\"I believe that we will have an even larger majority, and it's going to be very important to have a large majority in the next Congress because I do believe we're going to flip the Senate,\" Stefanik said.",

The US will ensure a long-term military presence in Latvia and will provide support in strengthening our military capabilities in various programs,\" Spruds commented on the meeting.\n\nThe two sides discussed Latvia's strategic partnership with the US and joint work on the acquisition of Naval Strike Missile anti-ship missiles and Himars missile artillery systems. They also discussed Latvia's progress in strengthening its defense capabilities, working towards the establishment of the Selija military training ground and the introduction of a national defense service.\n\nThe officials also discussed the forthcoming NATO Summit in Washington, where one of the main topics will be the further development of NATO collective defense and support to Ukraine.\n\nSpruds underlined that US support is crucial to help Ukraine defeat Russia, as Ukraine is fighting for the security and values of the whole democratic world. Spruds also expressed confidence that the US will be able to reach a domestic political agreement on the essential aid to Ukraine.\n\nDuring his visit, the US Defense Secretary also visited the Michigan National Guard, with which Latvia has been cooperating for more than 30 years. In the context of recent years, particular emphasis should be placed on cooperation in the development of Lielvarde Air Base and the training of Black Hawk helicopter pilots.\n\nIn the coming years, cooperation is planned to be extended to missile artillery, command and control and drone capabilities. The Michigan National Guard will also be involved in the development of the Selija training area.\n\nIn addition, Spruds met with several senior US Congressional officials.",

        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"",

        "body": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In this episode of the Wine and Gold Talk podcast, the host discusses the challenges faced by young players in the NBA and how their differences could pertain to the teams they are drafted to, using the Cavs' Sharife Cooper and Emoni Bates, among other players around the league as examples.\n\nYou can also listen using your preferred podcast app. Subscription information is below.\n\nSubscribe and listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nRead the automated transcript of today's podcast below. Because it's a computer-generated transcript, it may contain errors and misspellings.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nWhat up Cavs Nation, I'm your host, Ethan Sands, and I'm back with another episode of the Wine and Gold Talk Podcast. It's just me today, it's another solo dolo episode of the Wine and Gold Talk Podcast, and I'm happy to bring you all the insight I got going on. But before we get into the games ahead of the week, you know, if you listened to our last podcast, Chris and I discussed the postseason potentials and what the brackets are looking like, and I noticed that the Lakers and Warriors are currently in the play-in mix at the 9 and 10 seeds respectively. And I couldn't find the last time both these teams had missed the playoffs and I wanted to give an update before I got into anything else that the last time. Before I got into anything else. The last time both these teams were not in the playoffs was the 2004-2005 season. That's like 20 years ago. That's insane to think about how much the game has been impacted by these two franchises and obviously Stephen Curry has a large part of that for the Warriors being drafted in 2009 with the 7th overall pick.\n\nI mean, it's LeBron James. He has been with the Lakers since the 2018-2019 season and it doesn't need to be mentioned his longevity in the league after being drafted first overall in 2003. But enough about players not related to the Cavs, I want to talk a little bit about the last game they played.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nI want to talk a little bit about the last game the Cavs played, because we didn't mention some key points in the last podcast, and I want to give you a mini preview of their next game. Let's lock in. The Cavs made franchise history against the Pelicans. Sam Merrill and Keris Laverte became the first duo in Cavs history to record 9 or more assists off the bench in a single game. They both finished the game with 9 assists. And yes, this is mentioning regular and postseason. It was also the first time in Cavs history that 3 players finished with 9 or more assists in a game adding Darius Garland to that mix, who finished with a game high 11 assist. The passing clinic resulted in the Cavs season high 38th assist in a game and they assisted on all but 9 made baskets in the wind over the Pelicans. I wrote a story for Cleveland.com about how Karras-Levert has stepped his passing game up especially when his shots aren't falling, and Wednesday's game was another example of that. He was just 1 of 6 from the field in 30 minutes played, but finished with 9 assists and the second highest team plus or minus with 27, only coming second to Sam Merrill, who had a career high 9 assists as I mentioned earlier, and was back to his old sharp shooting self knocking down 5 tre balls for 15 points in 28 minutes. And while the pelicans were seen complaining about calls and even talking about it in a post game press conference, there were instances where they tried to punk the Cavs like when Valen Chunis put his shoulder into Jarrett knocking him to the floor. But it didn't work as they had hoped for business as usual, as he has done on a consistent basis. And I think that's an area he's grown since last year's first round exit. He's just taking whatever happens as it is and continuing to do his job and show up regardless of what happened the previous possession, the previous day, the previous play, it doesn't matter. Jared Allen has shown up and is going to continue to show up for the Cavs every single game since missing the first 5 games of the regular season due to his bone bruise that we remember from preseason. And obviously, with how the Cavs are set up right now without Evan Mobley and Max Struis and don't know when they're gonna come back, the Cavs will need that to continue.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAnd what better way for that to continue than in their next game? The Cavs next game again, the Cavs got the Rockies coming up next on the schedule on Saturday. And we all know there's some history there. At least between two players. Dillon Brooks and Donovan Mitchell. Dillon Brooks, and obviously it's great for the Cavs to have Donovan Mitchell back in this game. Because, you know, Dillon Brooks could try and pull a couple things or two, but Donovan Mitchell is going to be able to assert his presence and like Chris wrote about in an article that came out today, the Donovan Mitchell effect is real and we've seen that in the last game against the Pelicans even though he wasn't getting his shots to go down as he would like, his presence was able to affect how the other Cavs players were able to impact the game.\n\nAnd that's a big thing. It's what comes with being the guy on any given team. And I wanna talk about being the guy on a team. And that for the Houston Rockets might be Dillon Brooks, it might be Fred Van Vliet, or it could be Jalen Green on any given night. But let's talk about Dillon Brooks for a second, because he's claimed himself as a villain.\n\nAnd I know I've said I'm a villain stan at times, but not in this case. My thing is that if you're a villain that adds to the plot, or your reasoning to being a villain makes sense or something of that nature, then sure. But Dillon Brooks has shown that without a surrounding team like he had in Memphis especially with the mind games. The Rockets are 11th in the west, and they shouldn't be competition for the Cavs, but they will try to test them mentally, especially with Sangoon being out. I take this game as one that Jared Allen can impose his will and attack the basket. The Cavs have used the strategy of working inside out, and it's worked to their advantage this entire year.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nThe Cavs have utilized their strategy of working inside out, which they developed since when Darius Garland and Evan Mobley first went out, and that allowed them to create more three-point perimeter shooting and also use Jared Allen as an offensive hub.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAnd in the game against the Rockets, I don't see a reason why Jared Allen doesn't touch the ball every possession down the court for the Cavs. You can always use him as an offensive help as we've learned he is capable of doing, and his passing game has also improved over the season. And he's able to continue and he should be able to continue to create when doubled. But in my eyes?\n\nThere isn't a player on the Rockets roster that should be able to compete with Jarrett in the paint. Sure, Jacque Landale and Jabari Smith Jr. match him in height, but their skill set I don't think is to the level of Jarrett's and if they try to switch Dillon Brooks onto him, I need Jarrett to put Dillon in the rim because that's a major mismatch. Like, there is no reason that Jared Allen should see Dillon Brooks in the paint and not simply attack. Obviously he is a great guy, an unselfish player, and what makes him so integral to this Cavs team. But if he gets Dillon Brooks in the paint, he should simply go to the rack. And I think that's gotta be his mindset for the entire Houston game. Obviously Sangoon was a huge part for them and losing him is huge for the Rockets\n\nEthan Sands\n\nThe other key point to make about this Houston Rockets game is Tristan Thompson is coming back. And after his 33rd birthday, we got to see how giddy he was to get back onto the court. He's been practicing with the team since his suspension started, he's been able to be around the team. Chris even mentioned him being a key portion in Darius Garland's excelment. And I mean, we talk about Alpharence and Goon being out and how Jared Allen needs to be able to attack that defense of the Houston Rockets, well, this might be the perfect welcome back game for Tristan Thompson, someone who needs to obviously reacclimate even though he's not being given the same kind of ramp up period as someone who's coming back from an injury, but there's still going to be a cardio aspect that he's continuing to get back into shape with. Obviously he's been doing whatever he could at practice, but there's no simulation of that like a regular NBA game. And Tristan Thompson, we know, imposes his will in almost every facet of a basketball game. So if Jared Allen is not going to do that. Maybe the Cavs go ahead and put Tristan Thompson in to get some added reps. Especially because we've seen recently that JB Biggerstaff has not been afraid to use a lineup with Damian Jones and Jared Allen in the same lineup. That's something that is interesting because we obviously know that Evan Mobley and Jared Allen played together. And I'm interested to see if JB Bickerstaff goes with the lineup, that could potentially have Tristan Thompson and Jared Allen in the same lineup to simply go crazy in the paint with just Jabari Smith Jr. in the paint. I don't know if JB Bickerstaff would do that because of having Damien still be a 4 or Tristan Thompson having 5 minutes and things of that nature.\n\nWe'll have to see what rotation he goes with, but I just like thinking of the idea that Tristan Thompson and Jared Allen could be in the paint together given the opposing Houston Rockets team that's down one of their most important players and someone who has been influential who has been doing his thing in the entire league this year in offering Sangoon and just attacking their paint.\n\nObviously it's a big blow for the Houston Rockets and we never want to see injuries happen to anybody in the league no matter of the circumstance But the Cavs needed as I've said before the Cavs need to take advantage of the situation presented to them Just like any team has done when they face an Evan Mobley-less Cavs team or a Donovan Mitchell-less Cavs team or a Max Strus-less Cavs team or a Dean Wade-less Cavs team. We've seen it all year with players and teams going at the Cavs' weaknesses when they've had injured players. I think this is an opportunity for the Cavs to do that back to the Houston Rockets.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nBut we know it's an 82 game season and the Cavs have proven themselves not to be pushovers. I don't think they have not to be pushovers. I think the Cavs have grown into the team that their fans have wanted them to be regardless of the matchup or however many men they were down. They've gone into battle night in and night out, proving people wrong on countless occasions.\n\nWhen the Cavs lost Darius Garland and Evan Mobley, it was said that the season was over. When the Cavs didn't have Donovan Mitchell, Max Struz, Dean Wade, Evan Mobley for multiple games, it was supposed to be a wrap. But this Cavs team has taken some of the hardest hitters, best punches, and kept moving, or swung back and landed a haymaker. To me, it feels like the mindset of this team is no matter who we got or what obstacle is in front of us.\n\nWe gonna ball. A matchup I look forward to is Jalen Green and whoever he gets matched up with because he's shown to be an offensive problem. He dropped 37 against the Wizards on Thursday and sure it was the Wizards but he showcased his skills. I don't know if the Cavs are gonna put Isaac Acura on him because obviously the Houston Rockets have Fred Van Fleet who can always be a problem.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nBut we've also seen Karis LaVert step up in that defensive role and honestly, all of the Cavs have stepped up in a defensive role with Dean Wade being away from the team. And that's something that we need to see continue because we know what the backbone of this Cavs team is. As good as they've been offensively, they always rely on their defense whenever they get into a pinch.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAnd I want to get more into the situation with Jalen Green and how it pertains to a bigger point when it comes to the NBA. But before then, I think we should take a break.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nWhen I come back, I'm gonna talk about Jalen Green. When I come back, I'm gonna talk about the state of the NBA and how players are coming into a league at such a young age. And there's different.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAnd there are different expectations based on the team that they land with and who they have in front of them.

I'll be right back.\n\nI believe that the opportunity that players are brought into can influence how they're going to pan out in the NBA, especially with how young these players are coming in. You get the G League Ignite.\n\nBecause players are available to come into the NBA at 19 years old. Obviously that has prevented players from coming straight from high school like some players used to like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, and others. But they're still coming at 19 years old after being one and done in college and not having a whole lot of experience. And I'm not even just talking about game experience. I'm talking about their body not being adjusted to those things. We talked to Craig Porter Jr. earlier this week about playing in his first NBA season and even though he is an older player coming into the league after playing 5 years in college, his body still needed to adjust to playing in the NBA and playing an NBA season. He mentioned that you have back to back games. You have games and then a day in between and then another game and all the time that you have in between is a travel day. That is wear and tear on the body and it's hard to accumulate that time schedule with your body at 19 years old because it's still learning, it's still adjusting and sometimes it's just simply not ready for those things.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAn example is that SLAM turns 30 this year, so they're documenting the 30 players who have helped them become who they are. And it reminded me of players like Jalen Green, Josh Christopher, and Sharif Cooper who were magazine cover players and top players coming out of high school. And although these young stars were touted as some of the best players they have vastly different stories in the NBA and Also, how they got there obviously Jalen Green took the G League ignite route and Has basically been a starter on a subpar Houston Rockets team since he entered the league Josh Christopher went to Arizona State It was on the same team as Jalen when he was drafted with similar skills and wasn't seen as a necessity for the Rockets with Green around. The Rockets decided to let him go. He's now bounced around the G-League trying to get his footing while Sharif, who played just a few games at Auburn and now is in the NBA, is an extremely talented point guard.\n\nAnd Shariff Cooper, who was at Auburn, although only having the opportunity to play in a few games, is an extremely talented point guard, and some believe he could be an NBA point guard right now. But, he's stuck in the Cavs G League system with the Cleveland charge. Far- with- with the Cleveland charge. With at least four point guards ahead of him in the pecking order because of where he landed. Also, he started his career in Atlanta behind Trey Young. There was minimal chance that he was getting playing time there anytime soon. And with De'Jonte Murray coming over there, that likelihood got even slimmer. And his size doesn't help the scenario in a league that's continuing to grow in size at the point guard position.\n\nDonovan Mitchell and Darius Garland are considered undersized guards and Sharif is shorter than them.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nThen you have players that are drafted extremely young and simply need game experience at the highest level and with the best coaches and trainers to simply reach their potential. And yes, I'm talking about Imani Bates, who simply isn't ready for the NBA stage yet as an all-around player, but his scoring ability is something that few have seen before. You can't take that away from him, but the ability to be coachable, get in the weight, put on some size and then continue to grow his game Defensively will make him a valuable asset to the Cavs in my opinion in my opinion in the future If he sticks around if he sticks with it He's just 20 years old. There's no need to rush him or for fans I'm saying this for you guys. There's no need to rush for him to get minutes, especially with him already on a two-way contract when he's able to be around a playoff contending team in his first season. And let's be honest, this is the best Cavs team Cavs roster since LeBron James left. The opportunity to be around the Cavs and how they operate on a daily basis shouldn't be overlooked for his development.\n\nIt's not just physical, but mental too. And sometimes you need to develop in one area more than the other, and sometimes it's both. Sometimes it's both. And I think Imani Bates could benefit from maturing in both areas.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nAnd I've liked being around Imani. I've liked around being around his play style, his energy, and you just see how vibrant he is as a person. So this is not taking anything away from how he interacts with the media, how he is as a person, or anything like that. I just don't want you guys as fan- I don't want the fans to get the idea that just because he has scoring ability doesn't automatically equates to he's ready for an NBA stage. There's a lot of things that go into it, and maybe me and Chris can go into it even further on a different podcast, but I feel like we've touched on a good amount today. So with all that being said, that'll wrap up today's episode of the Wine and Gold Talk Podcast.\n\nEthan Sands\n\nBut remember to become a Cavs Insider and interact with Chris and me by subscribing to Subtext.

        "title": "Black voters less swayed by Biden's message that Trump threatens democracy, poll shows",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Joe Biden's key campaign messages, that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is winning over fewer Black supporters and those without college degrees than other segments of his political base, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nWorries about political extremism and threats to democracy have emerged as among Americans' top concerns, following historic events including Republican former President Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Supreme Court's move to end the nationwide right to abortion and a surge in migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe online national poll of 4,094 respondents from March 7-13 showed Republicans and Democrats alike worry about America's democratic institutions and the prospect of highly partisan politicians pushing through policies most people don't want.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, a view that a majority of Republicans have adopted, and which Biden has warned could corrode voters' faith in the democratic process.\n\nSome 65% of poll respondents - including 72% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans - said they were worried \"partisan state legislatures will overturn the popular vote\" in some states to support a presidential candidate. Remaining respondents said they were not worried or didn't answer the question.\n\nEven higher shares of each party said they feared \"partisan-dominated governments enacting unpopular laws.\"\n\nAbout two in five Republicans and two in five Democrats consider the other party to be an imminent threat to the United States, according to the new poll.\n\nWhile the concerns were broadly held across different demographic groups, subtle differences in views within America's closely divided electorate highlight a concern among Democrats that some of Biden's supporters - notably those who are Black or without college degrees - might lack motivation to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSome 57% of Biden supporters in the poll said they were backing him to stop Trump, compared to 30% who cited support for Biden, suggesting the campaign focus on fear is helping allay Democrats' turnout concerns. Trump faces four criminal trials, including two tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nBut there were potential warning signs for Democrats.\n\nBiden's Black supporters, who make up about a fifth of his political base, were considerably less likely than his white backers to respond in the poll that they were voting to stop Trump, 37% to 65%.\n\nBlack Democrats were also less likely than white Democrats to say they were worried about a presidential candidate stealing an election or partisan state legislatures overturning its results. Black voters in the U.S. have skewed heavily Democratic for decades.\n\nAmong Biden supporters without college degrees, 53% said they wanted to stop Trump, compared to 64% of those with degrees.\n\nTo be sure, Biden is also campaigning on messages that he has helped the U.S. economy and pledges to defend abortion rights. Nearly half of Biden's Black supporters said they support him for his policies, compared to about a third of his white supporters.\n\n\"Highlighting the failures of Donald Trump is certainly part of that equation, but so is reminding voters of President Biden's accomplishments and providing a positive vision for the future,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who serves as partner at ROKK Solutions.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the campaign sees supporters motivated by a wide array of issues.\n\nIn a sign of America's broad concerns about government, some 72% of Democrats - including about the same share of Black Democrats - said they worried about unelected officials interpreting laws that affect their lives.\n\nAn even larger share of Republicans - 78% - shared that worry, which has been a key plank in Trump's campaign message that a \"deep state\" of unelected bureaucrats is ignoring the will of the people.\n\nVoters of all stripes said crime was an important issue in the coming election, including 84% of Democrats and 91% of Republicans. Similar shares cited the economy as important.\n\nDemocrats were much more likely than Republicans - 86% to 61% - to cite as important the growing gap between wealthy and average Americans. A similar share of Democrats said climate change was an important issue, but only about 40% of Republicans shared that view.\n\nClose to nine in 10 Democrats in the poll said protecting abortion access in their state was an important issue, compared to roughly half of Republicans.\n\nSome 81% of Republicans in the poll selected \"immigration making life harder for native-born Americans\" as an important issue, compared to 41% of Democrats.\n\nTrump has campaigned with a message that he will increase deportations of immigrants without legal standing.\n\nThe issue was considered important by about half of Democratic respondents without a college degree, and by about half of Black and Hispanic Democrats, underscoring Biden's potential vulnerability on immigration.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online with a nationally-representative sample of 4,094 U.S. adults, and had a margin of error of 1.7%.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; additional reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Scott Malone, Deepa Babington and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "The suddenly surging Buffalo Sabres have inched their way back into playoff race with 8-3-1 run",
        "body": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Someone evidently forgot to inform Dylan Cozens and the Buffalo Sabres that they were out of playoff contention when falling 12 points out of the race a month ago.\n\nThen again, Cozens wouldn't have accepted the notion even if someone had.\n\n\"Our belief is higher than ever right now,\" Cozens said after scoring in a 4-0 win over the New York Islanders on Thursday night. \"I think I said it a month ago, maybe weeks ago, that we still believe in this room that we can do it. And that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nFrom dropping to 13th place in the Eastern Conference standings -- and sitting closer to last than eighth -- following a 4-3 loss to Anaheim on Feb. 19, the Sabres are enjoying a remarkable resurgence. They've gone 8-3-1 since and closed to within three points of the Islanders and Detroit Red Wings in the race for the conference's final wild-card spot.\n\nCozens said one difference is Sabres players feeling more loose after spending much of the first part of the season carrying the weight of expectations to end what stands as an NHL-record 13-season playoff drought.\n\n\"I think if we're gonna go down, we're gonna go down with a fight. We're going to play like we honestly have nothing to lose,\" he said. \"We obviously know there's a lot to lose, but we can't talk about that when we're out on the ice.\"\n\nSuddenly, the shortcomings -- slow starts, a three-goalie rotation, injuries and the inability to win more than two in a row -- that swamped the Sabres over the first four months of the season appear to have been resolved.\n\nAnd keep in mind, Buffalo's last three wins, including a 3-2 shootout victory over Edmonton on Saturday, followed the team trading its captain, Kyle Okposo, to Florida, and trading it's top scorer, center Casey Mittelstadt, to Colorado in a deal for offensive defenseman Bowen Byram.\n\n\"I think I'll answer that one after we keep responding,\" coach Don Granato said, when asked about his reshuffled roster. \"We just have to keep responding so it's on to the next game. ... But to this point, yes, I think the energy's really good.\"\n\nThough the Sabres have yet to win four in a row, they're enjoying their second 3-0 run in three weeks.\n\nFor a team that still struggles to score the opening goal, Buffalo has opened the scoring in each of its past two, including a four-goal first-period eruption in a 7-3 rout of Detroit on Tuesday.\n\nAnd most significantly, the Sabres are riding a hot goalie in Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, who has gone 16-8-1 with four shutouts and 45 goals allowed in his past 25 outings since claiming the starting job in late December.\n\n\"It's enjoyable to watch because it's been a build,\" Granato said, in referring to both Luukkonen and rookie Devon Levi, who is now developing in the minors.\n\n\"It's something we've been tactically building for, is we took two young goalies into this organization, Levi and Upie, and we've made a commitment to two young goalies to develop them at the NHL level and that's not a common thing to do,\" he added. \"So, it's a good feeling when you see them progress the way they did.\"\n\nThere seemed nothing tactical about the plan when the Sabres opened the season banking on Levi to take over the reins, and with Luukkonen not getting his first start until Levi and backup Eric Comrie sustained injuries. And Granato's comments seem to deflect from the Sabres being second-guessed for carrying three goalies -- and taking up a valuable roster spot -- before finally demoting Levi to the minors in January.\n\nEither way, Luukkonen is dominating in his second full NHL season, and after he struggled during Buffalo's late-season playoff push last year.\n\n\"It means a lot, kind of finding my footing in the net and kind of proving to myself, too, that I'm an NHL-caliber goalie and I can handle the starts,\" Luukkonen said.\n\nThe key is maintaining focus.\n\n\"Once you kind of lose sight of the next game and start to think too far ahead, you really don't do any favors for yourself,\" he said. \"I think it's just kind of knowing what we've been doing right and trusting that.\"\n\nWith 15 games remaining, the Sabres still have a hill to climb with the team embarking on a five-game road trip which opens at Detroit on Saturday.\n\nCozens recalled how the Sabres closed last season going 9-2-1 only to fall two points short of a playoff berth.\n\n\"We knew what we did last year and found a way to get close. And I think, last year, we kind of let the outside noise make us think we were out of it,\" Cozens said. \"And that's something we've learned this year. Don't worry about the outside noise, just just worry about this dressing room.\"",

        "title": "The suddenly surging Buffalo Sabres have inched their way back into playoff race with 8-3-1 run",
        "body": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Someone evidently forgot to inform Dylan Cozens and the Buffalo Sabres that they were out of playoff contention when falling 12 points out of the race a month ago.\n\nThen again, Cozens wouldn't have accepted the notion even if someone had.\n\n\"Our belief is higher than ever right now,\" Cozens said after scoring in a 4-0 win over the New York Islanders on Thursday night. \"I think I said it a month ago, maybe weeks ago, that we still believe in this room that we can do it. And that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nFrom dropping to 13th place in the Eastern Conference standings -- and sitting closer to last than eighth -- following a 4-3 loss to Anaheim on Feb. 19, the Sabres are enjoying a remarkable resurgence. They've gone 8-3-1 since and closed to within three points of the Islanders and Detroit Red Wings in the race for the conference's final wild-card spot.\n\nCozens said one difference is Sabres players feeling more loose after spending much of the first part of the season carrying the weight of expectations to end what stands as an NHL-record 13-season playoff drought.\n\n\"I think if we're gonna go down, we're gonna go down with a fight. We're going to play like we honestly have nothing to lose,\" he said. \"We obviously know there's a lot to lose, but we can't talk about that when we're out on the ice.\"\n\nSuddenly, the shortcomings -- slow starts, a three-goalie rotation, injuries and the inability to win more than two in a row -- that swamped the Sabres over the first four months of the season appear to have been resolved.\n\nAnd keep in mind, Buffalo's last three wins, including a 3-2 shootout victory over Edmonton on Saturday, followed the team trading its captain, Kyle Okposo, to Florida, and trading it's top scorer, center Casey Mittelstadt, to Colorado in a deal for offensive defenseman Bowen Byram.\n\n\"I think I'll answer that one after we keep responding,\" coach Don Granato said, when asked about his reshuffled roster. \"We just have to keep responding so it's on to the next game. ... But to this point, yes, I think the energy's really good.\"\n\nThough the Sabres have yet to win four in a row, they're enjoying their second 3-0 run in three weeks.\n\nFor a team that still struggles to score the opening goal, Buffalo has opened the scoring in each of its past two, including a four-goal first-period eruption in a 7-3 rout of Detroit on Tuesday.\n\nAnd most significantly, the Sabres are riding a hot goalie in Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, who has gone 16-8-1 with four shutouts and 45 goals allowed in his past 25 outings since claiming the starting job in late December.\n\n\"It's enjoyable to watch because it's been a build,\" Granato said, in referring to both Luukkonen and rookie Devon Levi, who is now developing in the minors.\n\n\"It's something we've been tactically building for, is we took two young goalies into this organization, Levi and Upie, and we've made a commitment to two young goalies to develop them at the NHL level and that's not a common thing to do,\" he added. \"So, it's a good feeling when you see them progress the way they did.\"\n\nThere seemed nothing tactical about the plan when the Sabres opened the season banking on Levi to take over the reins, and with Luukkonen not getting his first start until Levi and backup Eric Comrie sustained injuries. And Granato's comments seem to deflect from the Sabres being second-guessed for carrying three goalies -- and taking up a valuable roster spot -- before finally demoting Levi to the minors in January.\n\nEither way, Luukkonen is dominating in his second full NHL season, and after he struggled during Buffalo's late-season playoff push last year.\n\n\"It means a lot, kind of finding my footing in the net and kind of proving to myself, too, that I'm an NHL-caliber goalie and I can handle the starts,\" Luukkonen said.\n\nThe key is maintaining focus.\n\n\"Once you kind of lose sight of the next game and start to think too far ahead, you really don't do any favors for yourself,\" he said. \"I think it's just kind of knowing what we've been doing right and trusting that.\"\n\nWith 15 games remaining, the Sabres still have a hill to climb with the team embarking on a five-game road trip which opens at Detroit on Saturday.\n\nCozens recalled how the Sabres closed last season going 9-2-1 only to fall two points short of a playoff berth.\n\n\"We knew what we did last year and found a way to get close. And I think, last year, we kind of let the outside noise make us think we were out of it,\" Cozens said. \"And that's something we've learned this year. Don't worry about the outside noise, just just worry about this dressing room.\"\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

        "title": "Hard-throwing teens draw scouts, scholarships. More and more, they may also need Tommy John surgery",
        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "title": "'It was the life raft': Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida's capital city",
        "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Quandarius \"Chanel\" Johnson twirled a gold-colored crown that glinted with light streaming in from a nearby window. It's a symbol to remind her of her strength. After all, \"I'm a Leo,\" Johnson said.\n\nShe keeps the crown hanging on her bedpost. Johnson, a Black transgender woman, lives in a safe house not far from the Florida Capitol, where lawmakers in recent years have placed new restrictions on transgender people, as have legislators in other Republican-dominated states. Last spring, for example, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors, and another barring transgender people from using the restroom that matches their gender identity.\n\nTucked in a quiet neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Florida's capital city, the four-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot house with a brick archway and shrub-lined walkway is just 5 miles from the capitol building. But it offers a sanctuary -- albeit a limited one -- from the transgender debates roiling the Florida legislature.\n\nLaunched by Capital Tea, a local transgender outreach nonprofit, it opened in December 2022 and has five resident beds plus another bed for emergency stays. The money to run it comes from foundations and nonprofits concerned about violence against LGBTQ+ people, said director Janel Diaz.\n\nTransgender and gender-nonconforming adults are more likely to be homeless, with many of them kicked out of their homes by disapproving relatives, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. About 1 in 5 transgender people have experienced homelessness at some point, the National Center for Transgender Equality reports, and Black people make up a disproportionate number of them.\n\n\"When I came out to my family, I was kicked out of my house, too,\" said Diaz, who is transgender. Then 18, she lived on the streets for a year. \"To some people that might seem not a lot. But for me, it seemed like an eternity.\"\n\nResidents can stay for up to a year at Capital Tea's safe house, which is reserved for transgender women. This summer, Diaz said, the group plans to open a house for transgender men. She hopes to grow the program beyond Florida and create a model program for other states and cities.\n\n\"I want it to be to where it is not just Tallahassee-based,\" Diaz said. \"I want Capital Tea to be the Underground Railroad of trans housing.\"\n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, where gender-affirming health care for youth is now illegal under state law, My Sistah's House offers a shelter for transgender women. Tennessee, like Florida, is GOP-dominated, but similar homes exist in Democratic-controlled states.\n\nA ministry group runs the R&R Space in Michigan; a group of Republican lawmakers in that state last month discussed banning transgender health care for everyone.\n\nOther examples include a transitional housing program run by the Transgender Emergency Fund of Massachusetts, and one run by the TransLatin Coalition in Los Angeles.\n\nThe issue of housing resonates throughout transgender communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a series of reports on transgender women, HIV disparities and housing. Among 1,566 transgender women, 31% reported being homeless for between a month and a year. In addition, more than half of transgender women who reported being evicted or denied housing due to their gender identity also reported being homeless for that amount of time.\n\nElle Lett, a University of Washington School of Public Health statistician-epidemiologist, who is a Black and trans woman, has researched the issue.\n\n\"Trans people are subjected to interpersonal and structural discrimination that often leaves them unhoused, without social supports, and these things are exacerbated by other intersecting systems of oppression like racism and ableism,\" said Lett, who is also a medical school student at the University of Pennsylvania. \"They have a lot working against them.\"\n\nPublic health experts note that housing and well-being are closely linked. Christopher AhnAllen, director of inpatient psychology at Brigham & Women's Hospital and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said places such as the Capital Tea home \"create spaces of love and joy and wellness that are essential to contrast the hostility and hate that may exist in other spaces.\"\n\nThe house in Tallahassee is decked out with contemporary-style furniture -- velvet gray sofas, pink candles and tall lamps that glow different colors. Heavy incense wafts through the air. A rec room closet has a stack of board games and donations of clothes and toiletries.\n\nJohnson, who has HIV, receives health care from a local clinic for low-income HIV patients. But she doesn't know how she will pay for her upcoming medical transition.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, she had more pressing concerns on her mind. Johnson and her housemate Jae Cancel had just finished tidying for incoming residents, and Diaz announced that she was making a run to McDonald's.\n\nCancel, 20, has been homeless since they were 15. Cancel's mother kicked them out multiple times, shuffling the then-teen to their father's house, where they said they were beaten. Stateline agreed to use a pseudonym for this story and withheld Cancel's full name for their safety.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, before connecting with Capital Tea, Cancel got off the streets and was doing yard work for a homeowner in exchange for a room in an RV. The situation quickly deteriorated, however, and Cancel didn't feel safe.\n\nAfter Capital Tea saw Cancel's social media posts about the housing situation, Diaz and her team got them a hotel room before taking them to the local homeless shelter, where they shared a room with other homeless transgender youth until the Capital Tea house became ready at the end of the year.\n\n\"It was the life raft thrown when you least expect it,\" Cancel said.\n\nCancel shared a room and single bathroom with other trans residents at the homeless shelter, and was followed around the premises several times.\n\n\"Here [at the Capital Tea house], I know that I'm not going to be judged when I turn this corner, and I'm not going to be talked about,\" Cancel said. \"I'm able to really sit in silence and stillness.\"\n\nJohnson was 18 when she started wearing lashes and getting her hair done. But her family in rural Georgia rejected her transgender identity.\n\nAt 19, she moved to Tallahassee to get away. At 22, her mother died while Johnson was living with a roommate who didn't accept her identity and was \"toxic,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It had me in a low place,\" she said, her chin trembling, adding that living with her previous roommate \"felt like I was still being robbed of who I was as a person.\"\n\nShe met and befriended Diaz through local drag shows.\n\n\"I need to get out of this situation,\" Johnson said she told Diaz. \"She [Diaz] was like, 'Can you hold on, and I got you?' I did what I needed to do to maintain.\"\n\nOne day, Johnson got a phone call.\n\n\"I've got a surprise for you,\" Diaz told her. She picked Johnson up and brought her to the house. \"This is going to be where you'll be staying.\"\n\nJohnson said she sees herself and her housemates as a \"sisterhood.\"\n\n\"She didn't know me from a can of paint, but she knew I was connected to her in some type of way,\" she said about having Diaz as a mentor and \"second mom.\" \"She's been one person that has literally been in my corner.\"\n\nJohnson said she is relieved to have shelter.\n\n\"You can't box something that was never meant to fit in,\" she said.\n\nNada Hassanein is a health care reporter for Stateline with a focus on inequities.

        "title": "World Sleep Day: Global survey finds that nearly 40% are not sleeping well",
        "body": "San Diego (Mar 15) - On World Sleep Day, data from a new sleep survey shows that a good night's rest eludes many.\n\nResMed today announced the results of its 2024 Global Sleep Survey in conjunction with World Sleep Day (March 15), shedding light on the critical sleep challenges faced by people around the world.\n\nThe survey uncovered a staggering number of people suffering from a chronic lack of good sleep, with nearly 40% of respondents getting no more than three nights of good sleep each week - and some individuals reporting just one. Respondents reported feeling excessive daytime sleepiness (50%), negative feelings in the morning (40%) and more irritable (39%).\n\nIn its fourth year, the survey included 36,000 participants across 17 markets providing insights on the state of sleep around the world.\n\nAcross the surveyed population, only 13% of respondents reported sleeping well every night. People in Japan (57%) topped the list for the number of poor nights' sleep each week while people in India were the most rested with 27% saying they sleep well every night.\n\nOver half of survey respondents used a digital device before going to bed, whether to scroll through social media (53%), watch TV (44%) or catch up on news (31%).\n\nWhen asked about what was keeping them awake, the top reasons that emerged were personal anxiety (36%), insomnia (25%), breathing difficulties (15%), and obesity (13%).\n\nEven after falling asleep, 3 in 10 respondents reported being unable to stay asleep without being woken up. People in the UK (44%) and France (42%) experienced the most disruption to their sleep while respondents from India (42%) and Thailand (41%) were most likely to fall and stay asleep the entire night.\n\nAmong female respondents who are perimenopausal or menopausal, 56% suffer from disturbed sleep, with women in Ireland and Australia being the most affected. In both countries, 3 in 4 women that are perimenopausal or menopausal said they suffer from disturbed sleep.\n\n\"With sleep being the third pillar of health, alongside diet and exercise, prioritizing your sleep is one of the most effective ways to improve your overall health,\" said Carlos, M. Nunez. M.D., ResMed Chief Medical Officer. \"Poor sleep can be an indicator of conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea, so this World Sleep Day we want to empower people to take charge of their sleep health and have conversations with their healthcare provider.\"\n\nAmong survey respondents, 57% claim they are aware of sleep apnea, a chronic disease in which the muscles of the throat relax to the point of collapse, restricting airflow and causing the sufferer to stop breathing repeatedly throughout the night. Notably, however, only 26% of those respondents have been diagnosed.\n\nThe 2024 ResMed Global Sleep Survey included a total of 36,000 respondents across 17 markets including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, UK and USA, between December 2023 and January 2024.",

        "body": "Indianapolis - \"Es ist die reine Verwüstung\", beschreibt es eine Augenzeugin. Wirbelstürme haben in den USA Menschenleben gefordert und erhebliche Schäden verursacht. US-Medien sprechen von \"Gorilla-Hagel\".\n\nHeftige Wirbelstürme und Tornados haben in den USA mindestens zwei Menschen das Leben gekostet und erhebliche Schäden angerichtet. Betroffen waren vor allem die Bundesstaaten Indiana, Ohio und Kentucky, wie örtliche Medien berichteten. Es gebe mehr als 20 Verletzte, meldete CNN. Innerhalb weniger Stunden wurden laut dem Sender ABC News am Abend mindestens acht Tornados gezählt.\n\nZwei Menschen seien in Lakeview (Ohio), rund 200 Kilometer nördlich von Dayton, in einer Siedlung von Mobilheimen (transportable Häuser) im Sturm getötet worden, teilte Sheriff Randall Dodds Medienberichten zufolge in der Nacht mit. \"Der Schaden hier ist einfach unglaublich\", zitierte ihn der Sender NBC News.\n\n\"Es ist die reine Verwüstung\", sagte die Vorsitzende der örtlichen Handelskammer in Lakeview, Amber Fagan, dem Sender ABC 6 News. \"So etwas habe ich in meinem ganzen Leben noch nicht gesehen. Unser Gemeindegebäude ist zerstört, unser Waschsalon ist weg\", ergänzte sie. Auf Fotos in Lokalmedien waren abgedeckte Häuser und umgeknickte Bäume zu sehen.\n\nIn der Kleinstadt Winchester (Indiana) habe es \"viele, viele schwere Verletzungen\" gegeben, sagte ein Polizeisprecher. Genaue Zahlen konnte er nicht nennen. Zuvor hatte es Berichte von mindestens drei Toten dort gegeben. Dies konnte der Sprecher aber nicht bestätigen. Ein genaueres Bild der Lage werde erst möglich sein, wenn eingestürzte Gebäude untersucht worden seien.\n\nIm Bezirk Randolph, wo auch Winchester liegt, seien zudem ein Supermarkt und ein Schnellrestaurant zerstört worden, berichteten örtliche Medien. In der rund 750 Einwohner zählenden Ortschaft Selma, rund 25 Kilometer westlich, habe der Sturm etwa 50 Prozent aller Bauten beschädigt, teilte der Katastrophenschutz mit. Glücklicherweise habe es dort nur einige Leichtverletzte gegeben.\n\nAuch aus der Ortschaft Milton (Kentucky) gab es Berichte von mindestens 50 durch Stürme beschädigte Gebäude.\n\nWegen beschädigter Leitungen sei auch vielerorts der Strom ausgefallen, hieß es in den Berichten weiter. Laut der Seite Poweroutage.us waren in Indiana, Ohio und Kentucky am Freitagmorgen rund 50.000 Haushalte ohne Elektrizität. Viele Schulen blieben am Freitag geschlossen.\n\nBereits am Mittwoch hatten schwere Stürme die Bundesstaaten Kansas und Missouri getroffen. Mancherorts fiel Hagel - mit Klumpen so groß wie ein Baseball. US-Medien sprachen von \"Gorilla-Hagel\". Colorado erlebte derweil heftige Schneefälle.\n\nExperten führen die Häufung von Naturkatastrophen in den USA - Stürme, Überflutungen und Waldbrände - auch auf die Folgen des Klimawandels zurück.",

        "title": "Analysis-US automakers race to build more hybrids as EV sales slow",
        "body": "DETROIT (Reuters) - As U.S. sales of gas-electric hybrid vehicles surge and electric-vehicle sales cool, automakers and suppliers are betting consumer demand for a compromise between all-combustion and all-electric is a durable trend.\n\nAutomakers and suppliers are adding capacity to build gasoline-electric hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the U.S. market, responding to increased consumer demand for technology that General Motors and other automakers once planned to phase out in favor of all-electric fleets, industry executives and analysts said.\n\nU.S. sales of hybrids grew five times faster than EV sales in February, Morgan Stanley said. A plug-in hybrid version of the Jeep Wrangler SUV accounted for half of total U.S. Wrangler sales in the second half of 2023, up from 37% in the first half of the year, Stellantis said.\n\nSales of Ford Motor hybrids rose nearly 37% during the first two months of the year, driven by demand for the hybrid Maverick compact truck that starts at $25,315.\n\n\"The hottest car on our lot right now is the Maverick hybrid,\" said Scott Simmers, general manager at Palm Springs Motors in Cathedral City, California.\n\nThe hybrid Maverick now accounts for about half the model's sales and dealers said they could sell more if Ford could build them.\n\n\"We had to rush to add capacity for Maverick,\" Jim Baumbick, Ford vice president for product development, told Reuters. \"We added a whole third shift to respond to demand.\"\n\nThe industry shift toward hybrids challenges the Biden administration's pro-EV climate policies, and environmental groups that want automakers to phase out CO2-emitting internal combustion engines as quickly as possible.\n\nThe White House is expected this month to issue vehicle CO2 emissions standards designed to force automakers to increase the share of fully electric vehicles they sell to as much as 60% by 2030.\n\nThe November U.S. presidential election puts the White House's EV subsidies and emissions rules at risk, however. Most legacy automakers lose money on EVs and hybrids are a more profitable path to reducing CO2 emissions if a future administration changes course, analysts said.\n\n\"Hybrids are a big hedge against an administrative change that cools down the push from a regulatory standpoint,\" said Mark Wakefield, head of AlixPartners' global automotive practice.\n\nSupporters of strong limits on combustion-engine emissions are concerned the Biden administration could offer incentives for automakers to sell more plug-in hybrids with combustion motors. \"If the hybrids are flying off the lot, there is no need for EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) to further encourage their sale with loopholes that allow more pollution,\" said Dan Becker of the Center for Biological Diversity in Washington.\n\nLed by Toyota, Ford and Honda, North American production of hybrids could rise to as much as 20% of total light-vehicle production by 2025, compared with 14% for EVs, according to data provided to Reuters by AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n\"While the EV outlook has been depressed by about a million units in the last year, hybrid models have surged by roughly the same volume,\" AFS Vice President Sam Fiorani told Reuters.\n\nINVESTING IN HYBRID DEMAND\n\nSuppliers such as Schaeffler are making long-term investments to expand capacity for hybrid production.\n\nThe German company plans to invest $230 million in a new factory in Dover, Ohio, to increase production of electric axles used in hybrid drive systems. Schaeffler currently supplies key components for the hybrid systems offered in Ford F-150 pickup trucks.\n\nFord has said it plans to double the share of hybrid F-150s to 20% of sales. Marc McGrath, chief of Schaeffler's U.S. operations, told Reuters he expects even wider adoption of hybrid powertrains for heavy-duty pickups and large sport utility vehicles.\n\n\"We see discussions with all the major (automakers) in that segment,\" McGrath said.\n\nHybrid demand is fueled by consumers like Jeremy Ashton of East New Market, Maryland.\n\nFrustrated by the poor fuel economy of his V-8 powered Ford F-150 truck, Ashton shopped for a replacement and bought an F-150 hybrid for about $61,000. Comparable gasoline-only trucks \"were priced the same. Some of the gas ones are more expensive,\" Ashton said in an interview.\n\nAshton said he did not like the looks of Ford's all-electric Lightning pickup or the challenge of charging. So far, Ashton said his white hybrid F-150 is delivering 22 to 24 miles per gallon. \"It is much better on gas.\"\n\nDave Wilson, head of the Preston dealership group in Maryland, said he began ordering more hybrid models last August and September. \"We were bullish on them,\" he said. In December, hybrids accounted for about 35% of total F-150 sales at the dealership.\n\nFor the 2024 model year, Ford F-150 hybrids will start at the same price as F-150s with 3.5 liter turbo-charged EcoBoost engines.\n\nToyota, long the leader in the U.S. hybrid market, plans significant increases in the number of hybrid models and overall sales of hybrids, Toyota brand chief David Christ told Reuters.\n\n\"Last year, 29% of sales were hybrid. Year-to-date it is 37%. We expect this year to be closer to 45% of our total volume,\" Christ said.\n\nToyota's next-generation Camry sedan launching this year will be offered only with hybrid powertrains.\n\nToyota has narrowed the price premium it charges for hybrids over comparable combustion-engine vehicles as it has scaled up production. The price gap used to be as much as $6,000 to $7,000, Christ said. Now, it is $1,500 and $2,000.\n\n\"That's more attainable and the consumer sees more value in the car,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "US lawmakers see TikTok as China's tool, even as it distances itself from Beijing",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- If some U.S. lawmakers have their way, the United States and China could end up with something in common: TikTok might not be available in either country.\n\nThe House on Wednesday approved a bill requiring the Beijing-based company ByteDance to sell its subsidiary TikTok or face a nationwide ban. It's unclear if the bill will ever become law, but it reflects lawmakers' fears that the social media platform could expose Americans to Beijing's malign influences and data security risks.\n\nBut while U.S. lawmakers associate TikTok with China, the company, headquartered outside China, has strategically kept its distance from its homeland.\n\nSince its inception, the TikTok platform has been intended for non-Chinese markets and is unavailable in mainland China. It pulled out of Hong Kong in 2020 when Beijing imposed a national security law on the territory to curtail speech. As data security concerns started to rise in the U.S., TikTok sought to reassure lawmakers that data gathered on U.S. users stays in the country and is inaccessible to ByteDance employees in Beijing.\n\nTikTok's parent company is following the same playbook as many other Chinese companies with global ambitions: To win customers and trust in the United States and other Western countries, they are playing down their Chinese roots and connections. Some have insisted they be called \"global companies\" instead of \"Chinese companies.\"\n\nBut for TikTok, this may not be enough. The House bill passed overwhelmingly on a 352-65 vote. Its prospects in the Senate are uncertain, but if it clears both chambers, President Joe Biden said he would sign it into law. The moves in Washington threaten the app's survival and cast a spotlight on the quandary that many private Chinese companies have found themselves a part of as they seek to engage Western markets at a time of souring U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"It's the most difficult time for Chinese tech companies and private businesses in decades as tensions and rivalry between the United States and China continue to grow,\" said Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University.\n\n\"These companies and businesses face squeezing from both sides as they struggle to survive,\" Zhu said. \"While the U.S. and other Western countries have imposed sanctions or restrictions on these companies, China itself has moved to favor state-owned enterprises in recent years, leaving little room for Chinese tech and private businesses to operate.\"\n\nAlex Capri, senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore and research fellow at Hinrich Foundation, agreed that companies like TikTok with Chinese roots are \"really stuck in two polar extremes\" between the heavy-handed communist party and the deeply suspicious West.\n\n\"Any Chinese tech company has to operate under a cloud of suspicion, and that's because there's a total breakdown of trust,\" Capri said.\n\nWith the rise of techno-nationalism, by which technological capabilities are deemed a national strategic asset, China's tech companies are obligated by Beijing's laws and rules to turn over data and have become \"essentially a de-facto representative\" of China's ruling communist party, Capri said.\n\n\"That in itself makes it very challenging for companies like TikTok,\" he said.\n\nIn 2018, Zhang Yiming, the founder of ByteDance, toed the party line after Beijing shut down ByteDance's jokes app. He apologized publicly for his company's deviations from socialistic core values and promised to \"comprehensively rectify the algorithm\" on its news app and add significantly more layers of censoring -- a move considered necessary for any company to survive in China.\n\nThat explains the oft-repeated claim by Rep. Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select Committee on China's communist party, that \"there's no such thing as a private company in China.\"\n\nThe bill, as approved by the House, seeks to remove applications from app stores or web hosting services in the U.S. unless the application severs its ties to companies -- such as ByteDance -- that are subject to the control from foreign adversaries, like China.\n\n\"This is my message to TikTok: Break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,\" said Gallagher, the bill's sponsor. \"America's foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. TikTok's time in the United States is over unless it ends its relationship with CCP-controlled ByteDance.\"\n\nCongressional mistrust of TikTok was evident at a Jan. 31 hearing when Sen. Tom Cotton repeatedly asked CEO Shou Zi Chew if he is a Chinese citizen beholden to the Communist party. Chew, who is Singaporean, repeatedly said no.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi said it's problematic that ByteDance, which owns the social platform's algorithm, is subject to Beijing's control.\n\nChew, in another congressional hearing last year, told Congress that \"we do not remove or promote content on behalf of the Chinese government.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Wired magazine, Chew acknowledged that the company's Chinese origins have given TikTok a \"bigger trust deficit than most other companies.\"\n\n\"Maybe our trust starting line is behind other businesses, but I also think that there are very serious approaches that we've taken to try and earn that trust and to close that gap,\" Chew said, citing efforts by TikTok to protect U.S. user data, be transparent and \"not be manipulated by any government.\"\n\nShort of severance from the home country, Chinese companies chasing global ambitions have tried to distance themselves from China by introducing many foreign investors, hiring foreign executives, moving headquarters to outside China and limiting operations to overseas markets, said Thomas Zhang, China analyst at FrontierView, a U.S.-headquartered market intelligence provider. But \"the effects are limited as long as the founder in China does not relinquish control,\" Zhang said.\n\nFor TikTok, the trust is so lacking that even a full divestiture from its Chinese parent company may not work, because complicated ownership structures can obscure potential Chinese ownership, Capri said.\n\nAs TikTok fights for survival, it has made a move that is very present in American politics: It's engaging in heavy lobbying, and appealing to its 170 million U.S. users to contact their lawmakers to say a TikTok ban would infringe on their free speech rights.\n\nIt's won over one powerful critic: Former President Donald Trump, in a reversal, came out against the TikTok legislation. But Trump, for all his sway with congressional Republicans, couldn't prevent House passage.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, Capri said, TikTok could pursue the ultimate American recourse: a lawsuit to challenge the ban.",

        "title": "Self-driving cars enter the next frontier: freeways",
        "body": "PHOENIX -- Last year, self-driving robotaxis took on city streets. Now, they're taking on freeways.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving car startup owned by Google's parent company, recently started testing driverless rides on freeways in Phoenix, using employees as passengers.\n\nIt's a crucial step for the industry. Enabling cars to take freeway routes can cut ride times by as much as half, Waymo has said, and could help the company scale operations. Robotaxi outfits have poured billions into developing this technology and, if they can't offer routes such as airport rides, their path to profitability becomes more uncertain.\n\nFreeway rides would likely be most useful in ferrying passengers to and from airports, as well as driving in cities such as Los Angeles, where freeways are integral to getting across town. Several companies are also moving forward with plans to deliver goods using self-driving trucks on freeways, a market that some executives think will produce a quicker return on investment.\n\nThe stakes are higher than ever, and patience is running thin for mistakes. It has taken 15 years for Waymo -- one of the earliest entrants to the self-driving space -- to take this step. Driving on freeways will significantly increase the riskiness of its operations.\n\nCruise, another self-driving car company, majority-controlled by General Motors, lost its permits to offer driverless rides in San Francisco last fall after one of its vehicles dragged a woman -- who had been hit by another car -- about 20 feet. The firm paused all operations nationwide shortly thereafter.\n\nWaymo views Los Angeles, a city dense with freeways, as a potentially $2 billion market, co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said at a recent tech conference. This month, the company gained approval from California regulators to start charging for driverless rides on freeways in the Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles.\n\n\"You're seeing us make the moves that you have to make to build a profitable business -- long-term, sustainable profitable business,\" Mawakana said.\n\nFor now, Waymo is limiting its driverless rides on the freeway to Waymo employees to work out any kinks ahead of an expansion to the public. The company declined to say when that expansion would be. Aurora, an autonomous-technology company focused on trucking, plans to put driverless trucks on freeways in Texas this year.\n\n\"That speaks to their confidence,\" said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in self-driving cars. Waymo and other self-driving car companies still have to deal with risks around uncommon freeway driving scenarios, he added.\n\nWaymo has trained its vehicles for different scenarios they might face. But it is difficult to anticipate every obstacle. On city streets, the cars have faced unexpected hazards, such as people who deliberately run out in front of the self-driving cars to see whether they'll stop and others who put cones on the cars' hoods to interfere with their sensors. The passenger has no control over the car if there is an incident.\n\nPublic opinion on robotaxis in San Francisco has been mixed, with people quick to criticize the vehicles for mistakes such as stalling and causing traffic jams.\n\nOne bad accident could call into question Waymo's or Aurora's entire operations, as it did recently with Cruise and with Uber years before that. Uber sold off its entire self-driving business after one of its cars going 40 miles an hour struck and killed a woman during testing near Phoenix in 2018. Last month, Waymo issued its first-ever recall over a software problem after two of its cars in Phoenix collided with a pickup truck that was being towed backward.\n\nIn some ways, autonomous driving on freeways is actually easier than on city streets, industry experts say. There aren't as many pedestrians to deal with or intersections to navigate.\n\n\"Driving on freeways in this country -- even for humans -- is some of the safest driving there is,\" said David Zuby, chief research officer for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \"But because of the high speeds when crashes occur, the consequences are more severe. You're more likely to have injuries or fatalities.\"\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the vehicles is merging on and off freeway ramps. It requires them to run several calculations at once and make a quick decision while their surroundings are continuously changing -- similar to the situation the robotaxis faced making unprotected left-hand turns on city streets.\n\nThe rollout on freeways in Phoenix has largely been without trouble so far, Waymo says. The cars have been able to successfully navigate on and off ramps and haven't come to a halt in the middle of the freeway -- another issue that occurred on city streets.\n\nWhen the cars got confused or encountered a problem, they would sometimes stop where they were on the road, backing up traffic and frustrating other drivers who couldn't communicate with the car.\n\nSugandha Sangal, a product manager at Waymo, says they have built-in redundancies to prevent that from happening on fast-moving freeways. If one sensor system fails, there is another in place to help.\n\nOver the past year, Waymo vehicles in testing have been involved in a handful of incidents on freeways. Last March, one of the cars in San Francisco hit some tire scraps while transitioning from Interstate 280 to Interstate 380, causing damage to the car, according to state records.\n\nIn another incident the same day, a Waymo was driving itself on Bayshore Boulevard in San Francisco when a safety driver -- someone who sits in the driver's seat of the car and can take over in the case of an emergency -- crashed into another car that was stopped in the rightmost lane. Both vehicles sustained damage.\n\nWaymo declined to provide more details on the incidents but said that building trust with the communities in which they operate is important to them.\n\nPittsburgh-based Aurora, the driverless technology firm, spent the first few years after its 2017 founding looking for sensor technology that could allow cars to observe activity many feet away.\n\n\"If we're driving on the freeway and something breaks at 75 miles an hour, you can't just stop in the lane,\" Aurora CEO Chris Urmson said.\n\nIn 2019, Aurora purchased a Montana-based company called Blackmore that was developing a special sensor system. Aurora's self-driving technology can now detect objects more than 400 meters down the road, Urmson said.\n\n\"That was the bet for us that unlocked the possibility to go do trucking,\" said Urmson, who previously served as the head of Google's self-driving car project.\n\nBut their path hasn't been completely without incident. Last year, a truck outfitted with Aurora sensors was sideswiped by a car going 65 miles an hour.\n\nUrmson said the truck did all the right things and the incident would have been very difficult to avoid. He aims to have his trucks on freeways without safety drivers by the year's end.\n\nOther competitors in the space say they are still years out.\n\nAmazon-owned Zoox plans to launch public rides in Las Vegas this year with freeway driving in the very distant future. But even now, company executives recognize its potential.\n\n\"Once we can unlock driving on, say, 101, then that's a whole different ballgame,\" said Bryan O'Sullivan, a senior vice president at Zoox, referring to the California route also known as Pacific Coast Highway.\n\nCruise, before it lost its permits, wasn't planning to get on the freeway soon, according to people familiar with the matter. The company's immediate road map was focused on expanding to more cities, only on local streets.\n\nMeanwhile in Phoenix, some residents are excited about the prospect of taking a Waymo on the freeway.\n\nA local 23-year-old college student named Joel Johnson was one of the first members of the public to ride in a Waymo in downtown Phoenix when the company started rolling out passenger rides in 2022. He has been following Waymo for years and has taken dozens of rides, which he documents via his YouTube channel -- JJRicks -- with 10,000 subscribers.\n\n\"We've gone from good but jerky cars with safety drivers to extremely smooth and empty cars,\" Johnson said. \"If they say, 'We're ready for freeway,' then I say, bring it on.\"\n\n-- Sebastian Herrera contributed to this article.",

        "title": "Akron men's basketball coach John Groce wisely doubles down on trusting players | Ulrich",
        "body": "CLEVELAND -- Travis Steele knew the \"lunatic\" who coaches the University of Akron men's basketball team would have his players ready for tournament time.\n\nIt's why Steele is allowed to affectionately call Groce a \"lunatic\" while detailing the latter's passion for the game.\n\nIt's also why Steele fully expected Akron to bounce back after the Zips fumbled away the Mid-American Conference regular-season championship with upset losses to Eastern Michigan on March 5 and Western Michigan on March 8.\n\nIn an effort to get Akron back on track in time for the MAC Tournament, Groce wisely doubled down on trusting his players.\n\nSecond-seeded UA responded Thursday evening with a 75-63 victory over No. 7 Miami in a MAC tourney quarterfinal at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\n\nAkron (22-10) advances to face No. 3 Ohio (20-12) in a semifinal at 7:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe victor will meet the winner of No. 8 Kent State and No. 5 Bowling Green in the championship game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. The MAC's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament will be at stake.\n\nSteele had hoped to defeat Groce for the second time this season -- Miami edged visiting Akron 70-68 on Jan. 27 -- but now Steele will be cheering for the Zips to win the MAC tournament and enter March Madness like they did in 2022.\n\n\"Listen, it starts with my brother [and Akron senior forward] Enrique Freeman,\" Steele said. \"They've won this championship before, so you know they're going to be ready.\n\n\"All those [Zips seniors] came back for a common purpose, and that was to get back to the NCAA Tournament. So we knew they were going to be focused.\"\n\nUA was locked in, enabling it to shake off the nine-point deficit it encountered when Miami (15-17) went ahead 24-15 roughly midway through the first half. Akron captured a 37-35 halftime lead and never trailed again, finishing with a rebounding advantage of 44-28 and outscoring Miami 52-30 in the paint.\n\nMAC Player of the Year Freeman posted his 29th double-double this season, compiling game highs in points (30) and rebounds (12).\n\nFreeman explained the Zips have been carrying a chip on their collective shoulders since the regular season ended with a thud, leaving UA's players to \"accept the truth\" through self-reflection.\n\nGroce believed Freeman and other locker-room leaders would hold each other accountable. He gave them the freedom to do so. He thought the Zips prepared well mentally, physically and emotionally for three days preceding the tournament. His faith was rewarded again when Akron resisted panicking despite Miami punching the Zips in the mouth during the first half.\n\n\"Player-led teams are much more powerful than coach-led teams,\" Groce said.\n\nThe truth is Groce plays a pivotal role in setting the tone for UA. At the same time, he's been coaching long enough to realize the value in empowering players. All nine Zips who appeared in the game logged at least 10 minutes, a key to UA consistently pressuring the ball and ultimately winning the turnover battle 14-11.\n\n\"His passion -- I think his team feeds off that,\" Steele said. \"They feed off that [with] how hard they play. They're tough.\n\n\"John's got a great motor, and it serves him really, really well.\"\n\nAkron Zips advance in MAC Tournament: UA men's basketball wins quarterfinal vs. Miami. Details can be found here\n\nIn other words, Groce is a \"lunatic\" in a way conducive to successful coaching. There is a method to his madness in terms of how he handles his team.\n\n\"There's going to be ups. There's downs. There's going to be curveballs and change-ups, and you've just got to be able to deal with it,\" Groce said. \"When you do have an experienced group, it certainly helps. And these guys, they care about each other, first and foremost. I mean, they love each other, so I knew that they would respond.\"\n\nNow Groce hopes his team possesses more momentum and confidence than it did when the regular season wrapped up in puzzling fashion last week. He's also smart to point out none of it guarantees anything against Ohio in the semifinal round.\n\nMore 2024 MAC Tournament news: Scores, schedule, bracket, TV and livestream info can be found here\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.

        "title": "Hard-throwing teens draw scouts, scholarships. More and more, they may also need Tommy John surgery",
        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"",

        "body": "DETROIT, March 15 (Reuters) - As U.S. sales of gas-electric hybrid vehicles surge and electric-vehicle sales cool, automakers and suppliers are betting consumer demand for a compromise between all-combustion and all-electric is a durable trend.\n\nAutomakers and suppliers are adding capacity to build gasoline-electric hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles for the U.S. market, responding to increased consumer demand for technology that General Motors and other automakers once planned to phase out in favor of all-electric fleets, industry executives and analysts said.\n\nU.S. sales of hybrids grew five times faster than EV sales in February, Morgan Stanley said. A plug-in hybrid version of the Jeep Wrangler SUV accounted for half of total U.S. Wrangler sales in the second half of 2023, up from 37% in the first half of the year, Stellantis said.\n\nSales of Ford Motor hybrids rose nearly 37% during the first two months of the year, driven by demand for the hybrid Maverick compact truck that starts at $25,315.\n\n\"The hottest car on our lot right now is the Maverick hybrid,\" said Scott Simmers, general manager at Palm Springs Motors in Cathedral City, California.\n\nThe hybrid Maverick now accounts for about half the model's sales and dealers said they could sell more if Ford could build them.\n\n\"We had to rush to add capacity for Maverick,\" Jim Baumbick, Ford vice president for product development, told Reuters. \"We added a whole third shift to respond to demand.\"\n\nThe industry shift toward hybrids challenges the Biden administration's pro-EV climate policies, and environmental groups that want automakers to phase out CO2-emitting internal combustion engines as quickly as possible.\n\nThe White House is expected this month to issue vehicle CO2 emissions standards designed to force automakers to increase the share of fully electric vehicles they sell to as much as 60% by 2030.\n\nThe November U.S. presidential election puts the White House's EV subsidies and emissions rules at risk, however. Most legacy automakers lose money on EVs and hybrids are a more profitable path to reducing CO2 emissions if a future administration changes course, analysts said.\n\n\"Hybrids are a big hedge against an administrative change that cools down the push from a regulatory standpoint,\" said Mark Wakefield, head of AlixPartners' global automotive practice.\n\nSupporters of strong limits on combustion-engine emissions are concerned the Biden administration could offer incentives for automakers to sell more plug-in hybrids with combustion motors. \"If the hybrids are flying off the lot, there is no need for EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) to further encourage their sale with loopholes that allow more pollution,\" said Dan Becker of the Center for Biological Diversity in Washington.\n\nLed by Toyota, Ford and Honda, North American production of hybrids could rise to as much as 20% of total light-vehicle production by 2025, compared with 14% for EVs, according to data provided to Reuters by AutoForecast Solutions.\n\n\"While the EV outlook has been depressed by about a million units in the last year, hybrid models have surged by roughly the same volume,\" AFS Vice President Sam Fiorani told Reuters.\n\nSuppliers such as Schaeffler are making long-term investments to expand capacity for hybrid production.\n\nThe German company plans to invest $230 million in a new factory in Dover, Ohio, to increase production of electric axles used in hybrid drive systems. Schaeffler currently supplies key components for the hybrid systems offered in Ford F-150 pickup trucks.\n\nFord has said it plans to double the share of hybrid F-150s to 20% of sales. Marc McGrath, chief of Schaeffler's U.S. operations, told Reuters he expects even wider adoption of hybrid powertrains for heavy-duty pickups and large sport utility vehicles.\n\n\"We see discussions with all the major (automakers) in that segment,\" McGrath said.\n\nHybrid demand is fueled by consumers like Jeremy Ashton of East New Market, Maryland.\n\nFrustrated by the poor fuel economy of his V-8 powered Ford F-150 truck, Ashton shopped for a replacement and bought an F-150 hybrid for about $61,000. Comparable gasoline-only trucks \"were priced the same. Some of the gas ones are more expensive,\" Ashton said in an interview.\n\nAshton said he did not like the looks of Ford's all-electric Lightning pickup or the challenge of charging. So far, Ashton said his white hybrid F-150 is delivering 22 to 24 miles per gallon. \"It is much better on gas.\"\n\nDave Wilson, head of the Preston dealership group in Maryland, said he began ordering more hybrid models last August and September. \"We were bullish on them,\" he said. In December, hybrids accounted for about 35% of total F-150 sales at the dealership.\n\nFor the 2024 model year, Ford F-150 hybrids will start at the same price as F-150s with 3.5 liter turbo-charged EcoBoost engines.\n\nToyota, long the leader in the U.S. hybrid market, plans significant increases in the number of hybrid models and overall sales of hybrids, Toyota brand chief David Christ told Reuters.\n\n\"Last year, 29% of sales were hybrid. Year-to-date it is 37%. We expect this year to be closer to 45% of our total volume,\" Christ said.\n\nToyota's next-generation Camry sedan launching this year will be offered only with hybrid powertrains.\n\nToyota has narrowed the price premium it charges for hybrids over comparable combustion-engine vehicles as it has scaled up production. The price gap used to be as much as $6,000 to $7,000, Christ said. Now, it is $1,500 and $2,000.\n\n\"That's more attainable and the consumer sees more value in the car,\" he said.

        "body": "WASHINGTON - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defense's contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) after it plunged into crisis and is in talks with other EU members who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement's human rights clause.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would discuss support for Ukraine, coordination on the war in the Middle East, and reaffirm their support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBiden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage and is fond of quoting Irish poets, visited Ireland last April to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his support for the peace deal.\n\nDuring the tour of Ireland, the longest ever by a sitting U.S. president, Biden visited his ancestral hometown, had a chance meeting with the priest who performed the last rites on his son Beau, addressed the Irish parliament and attended a state banquet at Dublin Castle.

        "body": "(MT Newswires) -- Myles O'Grady, CEO of Bank of Ireland, notes that inflation in the eurozone has fallen and expects it to move closer to the 2% target in the next 12 to 18 months, which should influence monetary policy and lead to lower interest rates.\n\nThe bank has implemented hedging strategies to protect its interest income. Bank of Ireland generated a return of 17.3% last year and is targeting 15% by 2025, a target supported by an interest rate of between 2% and 3%.\n\nThe Irish domestic market, which accounts for 76% of the bank's profits, is a focal point for O'Grady. With banking consolidation in Ireland and economic growth expected to be between 3 and 4%, he is confident in the bank's ability to maintain its performance targets.\n\nHe reports that the bank's accounting balance sheet in Ireland, which summarises assets and liabilities, recorded a significant increase of 23% over the previous year. This growth was mainly attributed to robust activity in the mortgage market, increased income from corporate services, as well as an 8% expansion in the customer base. The wealth management sector also saw growth of 18%.\n\nOn the property market, although the commercial sector is struggling, O'Grady remains optimistic about quality, well-located office space. He acknowledges the strong demand for housing in Ireland, with production of 34,000 units against demand for 50,000.\n\nFinally, he notes the abundance of capital willing to invest in Ireland and the continued investor interest in Bank of Ireland, which is seen as a way of investing in the Irish economy as a whole.",

        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"",

        "title": "Gilead CAR-T cancer therapy capacity to quadruple by 2026",
        "body": "FREDERICK, Maryland (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences will be able to quadruple production of its cell therapy cancer treatments by 2026 due to improvements in the U.S. biotech's manufacturing processes, an executive in charge of that business told Reuters.\n\nCindy Perettie, executive vice president of Gilead's Kite cell therapy unit, said these changes have already allowed the company to increase the number of patient treatments it can produce to 10,000 annually from 6,000 last year.\n\n\"We expect by 2026, with the same footprint - not changing anything or investing - we will be at capacity for 24,000 CAR-Ts per year,\" Perettie said on Thursday in an interview at a company manufacturing facility in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nCell therapies like its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatments Yescarta and Tecartus are increasingly important to Gilead, which has been working for several years to build its presence in oncology and diversify outside of its core HIV business.\n\nGilead recently announced it reduced its median turnaround time to produce Yescarta to 14 days. Perettie said she expects the company will be able to shorten the turnaround time further this year.\n\nGilead paid nearly $12 billion in 2017 to buy Kite, one of the leading players in the emerging field of CAR-T therapies, which currently treat a variety of blood cancers. The company has said it expects oncology products to account for a third of its revenue by the end of the decade.\n\nCAR-T therapy involves removing a patients' own T cells - a key component of the immune system - engineering them to recognize and attack malignant cells, and re-infusing them.\n\nGilead, whose rivals in the field include Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis, is the market leader, according to Perettie.\n\nShe said the company expects to build its market share for Yescarta and Tecartus this year as it works to make the treatments available to more patients in more hospitals.\n\nGilead is expanding its network of health center sites across the U.S. where patients can receive the therapy, and \"doubling down\" on efforts to reach patients in its existing treatment sites in academic hospitals around the country, Perettie said.\n\nInitial growth will come from those academic hospitals, she said, adding that most of the growth from efforts to expand into more hospitals will not be seen until 2025.\n\nThe company expects to build the overall reach of CAR-T in the U.S. as well as its market share. More than 27,000 doses of the six approved CAR-T products have been administered in the U.S. since 2017.\n\nGilead's CAR-T revenue growth slowed recently, with sales dipping sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2023 to around $456 million for both treatments. Yescarta and Tecartus each costs more than $420,000 in the United States.\n\nThe company said last month that it expects first-quarter CAR-T sales to be flat or slightly up from the prior quarter, but that growth would pick up later this year.\n\nEarlier this week, researchers reported encouraging data from a small, ongoing study of a Gilead CAR-T therapy against recurrent glioblastoma, a deadly form a brain cancer.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Erman; editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)",

The US will ensure a long-term military presence in Latvia and will provide support in strengthening our military capabilities in various programs,\" Spruds commented on the meeting.\n\nThe two sides discussed Latvia's strategic partnership with the US and joint work on the acquisition of Naval Strike Missile anti-ship missiles and Himars missile artillery systems. They also discussed Latvia's progress in strengthening its defense capabilities, working towards the establishment of the Selija military training ground and the introduction of a national defense service.\n\nThe officials also discussed the forthcoming NATO Summit in Washington, where one of the main topics will be the further development of NATO collective defense and support to Ukraine.\n\nSpruds underlined that US support is crucial to help Ukraine defeat Russia, as Ukraine is fighting for the security and values of the whole democratic world. Spruds also expressed confidence that the US will be able to reach a domestic political agreement on the essential aid to Ukraine.\n\nDuring his visit, the US Defense Secretary also visited the Michigan National Guard, with which Latvia has been cooperating for more than 30 years. In the context of recent years, particular emphasis should be placed on cooperation in the development of Lielvarde Air Base and the training of Black Hawk helicopter pilots.\n\nIn the coming years, cooperation is planned to be extended to missile artillery, command and control and drone capabilities. The Michigan National Guard will also be involved in the development of the Selija training area.\n\nIn addition, Spruds met with several senior US Congressional officials.",

        "title": "Oklahoma's push to weaken penalties for cockfighting is frustrating opponents of the bloodsport - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "WILSON, Okla. -- Before Oklahoma became one of the last places in the U.S. to outlaw cockfighting in 2002, it wasn't uncommon to see hundreds of spectators packed into small arenas in rural parts of the state to watch roosters, often outfitted with razor-sharp steel blades, fight until a bloody death.\n\nMore than 20 years after the ban took effect, some worry Oklahoma is starting to waver.\n\nA proposal to weaken cockfighting penalties cleared the Oklahoma House. A political action committee is raising money to support farmers who raise game fowl. And in a video since pulled from YouTube, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt recorded a message supporting the group known as the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission, saying he would \"cheer you on from the sidelines.\"\n\n\"They've tried to make an official sounding name,\" said Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, which two decades ago worked to turn out Oklahoma voters and outlaw the activity. \"But they're just a bunch of cockfighters.\"\n\nHe said before the ban, rural Oklahoma counties were peppered with cockfighting arenas set up in large barns with stadium-style seating, overhead lights and even concession stands. Events attracted hundreds of spectators, even children and families. After a major event, it wasn't uncommon to see the property littered with dead bird carcasses after fights to the death.\n\n\"We went from 42 arenas, to... maybe there are 10 or 15 pits in the state,\" he said.\n\nThe reemergence of cockfighting as an issue in the Oklahoma Capitol is frustrating opponents who, until recently, considered the matter long settled. Rooster fighting is illegal at the federal level, punishable by up to five years in prison for some offenses. But a spate of recent cockfighting-related arrests in both Oklahoma and elsewhere is also a reminder that the practice has not been eliminated so much as driven underground.\n\nPolice in Hawaii have vowed to step up enforcement after one of the most serious mass shootings in that state's history happened last year at a cockfight where five people were shot, including two who died.\n\nFor his part, Stitt said he records dozens of videos each week and didn't give his participation much thought. \"Of course, I'm not for gamecock fighting in the state of Oklahoma,\" he told The Associated Press. But he also suggested he is open to reducing penalties if the state's GOP-controlled Legislature sends him a bill.\n\nThe video unleashed bipartisan blowback across Oklahoma, including from former Gov. Frank Keating, a fellow Republican. Oklahoma football legend Barry Switzer -- whose nickname in the state is simply \"The King\" after winning three national championships and a Super Bowl with the Dallas Cowboys -- also came after Stitt.\n\nBut the backlash doesn't faze Anthony Devore, head of the Gamefowl Commission, who says his organization has 15,000 members and described them as mostly hard-working rural Oklahomans. His group has raised more than $70,000 to lobby lawmakers and is seeking to replicate the same model in several other conservative Southern states, including in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky and Mississippi.\n\nDevore said he and others raise the birds to participate in poultry shows and sell them as breeding stock overseas. While cockfighting is illegal in many countries, it remains legal and popular in some Mexican states, the Philippines and some countries in southeast Asia.\n\n\"We represent game fowl farmers who breed and raise game fowl, but not for fighting purposes,\" said Devore, himself a game fowl breeder.\n\nBut Devore acknowledged a former district director for his organization who has since resigned was arrested and charged with facilitating a cockfight after authorities in Carter County raided a cockfighting pit with more than 100 people in attendance. That criminal case is pending.\n\nDevore and other members acknowledge they're operating in a gray area of the law and say reducing the penalties would remove the fear of felony criminal charges hanging over their heads.\n\nThe effort is welcome news to Troy Thompson, a former high school teacher and coach who now works full-time raising thousands of birds every year on his 55-acre (22.26-hectare) ranch dotted with white, tent-like structures near the town of Wilson in far southern Oklahoma, just 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) north of the Red River border with Texas.\n\nThompson, 50, said the chickens on his farm, who are kept on foot tethers so they don't fight with one another, are given vitamins, green grass year round and the highest quality feed he can buy. He said his chickens have a much better life than they would on a typical poultry farm, where they're raised in a tiny cage and slaughtered at about six weeks old.\n\n\"I had a rooster pass away last week that was 10 years old,\" he said. \"They have a lot better life living here than they're going to have on a Tyson poultry farm.\"\n\nThompson said he grew up during a time when rooster fighting was legal and dozens of farms dotted the rolling hills of southern Oklahoma. The name of his boyhood T-ball team was the Dillard Fighting Cocks.\n\n\"Would that go over today?\" he asked. \"It's mind blowing that you went from perfectly legal to facing a 10-year prison sentence.\"\n\nAnd while some law enforcement officers and prosecutors have been cracking down recently on those who raise and fight birds, with busts recently in both urban and rural communities, prosecutors say it's unlikely anyone has been sentenced to prison for cockfighting.\n\n\"I would say there's probably almost none (in prison),\" said Greg Mashburn, the top prosecutor for three central Oklahoma counties. \"In the 18 years I've been DA, we've only had two cases.\"\n\nStill, Mashburn said it's important to enforce anti-cockfighting laws because there is often a criminal element engaged in the activity that often involves illegal drugs and gambling.\n\n\"It's also cruel to the animals,\" Mashburn said. \"And where do you draw the line? If we allow that with chickens, why not dogs or other animals fighting to the death?\"\n\nStill, some animal rights supporters say other local sheriffs and prosecutors often turn a blind eye to the practice. Although the cockfighting ban passed in 2002 with 56% of the vote, 57 of the state's 77 counties were in favor of keeping cockfighting legal.\n\nDrew Edmondson, a former county prosecutor and attorney general for Oklahoma, now serves as a law enforcement co-chair for Animal Wellness Action. He said it's easy to understand why some elected officials in Oklahoma, even sheriffs, might look the other way when it comes to cockfighting.",

        "title": "Black voters less swayed by Biden's message that Trump threatens democracy, poll shows",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Joe Biden's key campaign messages, that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is winning over fewer Black supporters and those without college degrees than other segments of his political base, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nWorries about political extremism and threats to democracy have emerged as among Americans' top concerns, following historic events including Republican former President Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Supreme Court's move to end the nationwide right to abortion and a surge in migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe online national poll of 4,094 respondents from March 7-13 showed Republicans and Democrats alike worry about America's democratic institutions and the prospect of highly partisan politicians pushing through policies most people don't want.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, a view that a majority of Republicans have adopted, and which Biden has warned could corrode voters' faith in the democratic process.\n\nSome 65% of poll respondents - including 72% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans - said they were worried \"partisan state legislatures will overturn the popular vote\" in some states to support a presidential candidate. Remaining respondents said they were not worried or didn't answer the question.\n\nEven higher shares of each party said they feared \"partisan-dominated governments enacting unpopular laws.\"\n\nAbout two in five Republicans and two in five Democrats consider the other party to be an imminent threat to the United States, according to the new poll.\n\nWhile the concerns were broadly held across different demographic groups, subtle differences in views within America's closely divided electorate highlight a concern among Democrats that some of Biden's supporters - notably those who are Black or without college degrees - might lack motivation to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSome 57% of Biden supporters in the poll said they were backing him to stop Trump, compared to 30% who cited support for Biden, suggesting the campaign focus on fear is helping allay Democrats' turnout concerns. Trump faces four criminal trials, including two tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nBut there were potential warning signs for Democrats.\n\nBiden's Black supporters, who make up about a fifth of his political base, were considerably less likely than his white backers to respond in the poll that they were voting to stop Trump, 37% to 65%.\n\nBlack Democrats were also less likely than white Democrats to say they were worried about a presidential candidate stealing an election or partisan state legislatures overturning its results. Black voters in the U.S. have skewed heavily Democratic for decades.\n\nAmong Biden supporters without college degrees, 53% said they wanted to stop Trump, compared to 64% of those with degrees.\n\nTo be sure, Biden is also campaigning on messages that he has helped the U.S. economy and pledges to defend abortion rights. Nearly half of Biden's Black supporters said they support him for his policies, compared to about a third of his white supporters.\n\n\"Highlighting the failures of Donald Trump is certainly part of that equation, but so is reminding voters of President Biden's accomplishments and providing a positive vision for the future,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who serves as partner at ROKK Solutions.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the campaign sees supporters motivated by a wide array of issues.\n\nIn a sign of America's broad concerns about government, some 72% of Democrats - including about the same share of Black Democrats - said they worried about unelected officials interpreting laws that affect their lives.\n\nAn even larger share of Republicans - 78% - shared that worry, which has been a key plank in Trump's campaign message that a \"deep state\" of unelected bureaucrats is ignoring the will of the people.\n\nVoters of all stripes said crime was an important issue in the coming election, including 84% of Democrats and 91% of Republicans. Similar shares cited the economy as important.\n\nDemocrats were much more likely than Republicans - 86% to 61% - to cite as important the growing gap between wealthy and average Americans. A similar share of Democrats said climate change was an important issue, but only about 40% of Republicans shared that view.\n\nClose to nine in 10 Democrats in the poll said protecting abortion access in their state was an important issue, compared to roughly half of Republicans.\n\nSome 81% of Republicans in the poll selected \"immigration making life harder for native-born Americans\" as an important issue, compared to 41% of Democrats.\n\nTrump has campaigned with a message that he will increase deportations of immigrants without legal standing.\n\nThe issue was considered important by about half of Democratic respondents without a college degree, and by about half of Black and Hispanic Democrats, underscoring Biden's potential vulnerability on immigration.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online with a nationally-representative sample of 4,094 U.S. adults, and had a margin of error of 1.7%.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; additional reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Scott Malone, Deepa Babington and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "Bob Asmussen | History shows us, special Illinois seasons start at Big Ten tournament",
        "body": "CHAMPAIGN -- It's go time, Illinois men's basketball. When you see what you are made of and offer a glimpse of your potential.\n\nSome have suggested you would be better off losing early in the Big Ten tournament. That would give you a chance to rest up before the Big Dance.\n\nThey are wrong and foolish.\n\nI've got the 2004-05 Illini to back me up. Bruce Weber's team, the most accomplished in program history, didn't want to just win the conference tournament in 2005. It wanted to leave no doubt. Dee Brown, Deron Williams and pals beat Northwestern by 17 in the quarterfinals, Minnesota by eight in the semifinals and Wisconsin by 11 in the title game. That's an average victory margin of 12.\n\nThe lone disappointment for Illinois was it didn't get a rematch with Ohio State, the only team to beat it during an otherwise perfect regular season.\n\nThat team was eight points from a 39-0 finish. Had it happened, the season would rank among the very best in college basketball history. Oh ... so ... close.\n\nA different levelThe current Illini are not 2005 good. I know, I was there for all nine postseason games, when Illinois went 8-1 and won by 17, eight, 11, 12, 12, 14, one (Arizona classic) and 15. Impressive.\n\nBrad Underwood's team doesn't need to do all that to make the home folks happy. The Big Ten tournament title would be nice, especially if it includes an NCAA seed-improving win against Purdue.\n\nBut the good news is a loss in the Big Ten tournament won't be the end of the season. Just a reset. And coaching points for the boss Underwood and his staff.\n\nThe better way to go -- again looking back at 2005 -- is to just keep winning.\n\nIf not for shaky officiating in St. Louis (Sean May just committed another uncalled foul while you were reading that line), the Illini would have cut down the nets.\n\nThey did that at the United Center in Chicago after beating Wisconsin for the Big Ten tournament title.\n\nThat's the first check mark for the current team. While not as talented as the 2005 squad, there are some similarities. Both feature hard-charging guards, a versatile big man and the ability to score in bunches.\n\nI find the coaches share traits, too. Both Underwood and Weber are best described as old school. Funny that Weber's last stop was at Underwood's alma mater, Kansas State. Both dealt with misguided grumblings from some of the Illinois fan base, who will look back later and realize the program was in better hands than they imagined.\n\nWeber didn't have to deal with name, image and likeness or the transfer portal during his Illinois run. Brown, Williams, Luther Head and the rest would have pocketed bags of money if NIL been in place. Had they stayed together. But maybe one of the Texas schools would have tried to lure Williams back home.\n\nOf course, the transfer portal swings both ways, so Weber could have gotten some more inside help for James Augustine. Oh, well.\n\nThe current team can learn valuable lessons from the 2005 team. The most important and obvious: never give up. The 15-point deficit with the clock ticking down against Arizona wasn't insurmountable. Because they kept trying.\n\nToday, the victory is regarded as the most memorable in program history.\n\nOpportunity knocksMaybe another one of those magic moments is on the way. Perhaps in the quarterfinal or semifinal round at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nOr in the first or second round of the NCAA tournament at a destination to be determined on Sunday night.\n\nIllinois doesn't get to decide where it will play in the NCAA tournament. But the next three days give it a chance for an upgrade. Like when you are at the airport and the nice agent who knows your co-worker bumps you to first class.\n\nThe difference for Illinois between a No. 3 and a No. 4 next week is enormous. The No. 3 can avoid Houston or Connecticut until a later round. There will be upsets and sometimes the opponent you anticipate playing has a bad day.\n\nIf the matchups are right, Illinois can make a long run in the NCAA tournament.\n\nThis weekend, I'm guessing the team reaches the final, where it will face Purdue. With that No. 3 NCAA seed at stake.\n\nEnjoy.",

        "body": "TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Most teenagers celebrate their high school graduation with friends, family and maybe a party.\n\nBrandon Compton had Tommy John surgery.\n\nIt's been nearly 50 years since the game-changing procedure -- which reconstructs a torn ulnar collateral ligament in a pitcher's elbow -- was first performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on Tommy John's left arm in 1974. Since then, over 2,200 pros have tried extending their careers with the operation, most of them successfully.\n\nIn a more recent development, it's also helping teenage baseball players -- some as young as 14 -- get back on the mound after injuries early in their playing careers. Compton was 18 when he had the surgery on May 26, 2022, following his senior season in high school.\n\n\"Mentally, it killed me,\" Compton said. \"And I bet it's the same for everybody. You're a young player, you're going into college at a Power Five program, you're going to win all the time. That's not how it worked out.\"\n\nBut two years later, he's playing baseball for Arizona State.\n\nCompton's not alone in his early Tommy John journey. In 2023, there were 23 players selected in the first 10 rounds of the MLB amateur draft who had already had the procedure, one year after a record 31 players in 2022. To compare, just three players fit that description in the 2011 draft.\n\nThe relative success and normalcy of the surgery has been a boost for dozens of careers. But why do so many more young players need Tommy John?\n\n\"The past 15, 20 years, there's been a large increase in the number of tears,\" said Dr. Braiden Heaps, who works in the Phoenix area. \"And they're getting younger.\"\n\nDr. Gary Waslewski -- who works with the Arizona Diamondbacks -- said there are a number of factors that can cause a young baseball player to suffer an early elbow problem, including overuse, which has long been blamed for injuries.\n\nAnother culprit is something Waslewski called \"chasing velocity,\" which he defines as trying to add a few more miles per hour to a pitcher's fastball before a teenage body is ready. Waslewski did his fellowship for legendary orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in 1998, so he's been doing Tommy John surgeries about 25 years.\n\nWaslewski said young players should be very wary of throwing with weighted baseballs or attending camps that promise to add velocity in a short period of time.\n\n\"Velocity is the worst thing for the ligament,\" Waslewski said. \"Especially artifically trying to get your velocity up quickly. One of the biggest risks to ligament damage is a big personal gain in velocity. It's not how hard you throw -- but these big jumps in personal velocity over a short time are very damaging to ligaments.\n\n\"It's definitely part of what's driving some of the younger injuries. Velocity kills elbows.\"\n\nHayden Hurst's personal Tommy John story fits that profile -- he had the surgery at 14 after his eighth grade school year. The 30-year-old is now an NFL tight end for the Carolina Panthers, but in his teenage years, he was a high-level baseball prospect and eventually pitched in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a couple seasons.\n\nHurst said he wasn't chasing velocity as Waslewski described, but grew so quickly during his junior high years that he was 6-foot-1 by the time he was 14 and able to throw much harder than before.\n\n\"I was this eighth grader throwing 90, 91 mph,\" Hurst said. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nSure enough, Hurst's elbow gave out.\n\n\"The lucky thing for me is it happened when I was so young, so naive,\" Hurst said. \"Twelve months for a 14-year-old, you're just like, OK, well I can play video games. Honestly, it flew by.\"\n\nIt's understandable why young pitchers are trying to light up the radar gun. Pushing a fastball from 85 mph to 89 mph -- even just for one pitch, if seen by the right scout or recorded by the right computer -- could be the difference in getting offered an NCAA Division I scholarship or getting noticed for the draft by MLB teams.\n\nWaslewski said that young pitchers seeking more velocity should wait for their bodies to mature and do it the old-school way -- with long toss. It's basically just playing catch, but slowly increasing the distance during a session so that eventually the player is throwing the ball as far as possible. Waslewski said long toss allows the shoulder to build strength more naturally and doesn't put as much stress on the elbow.\n\nHeaps said one good development over the past 15 years is that teenagers already understand a big chunk of the Tommy John process when they walk through his door. Both Waslewski and Heaps said that because the surgery requires such a long recovery, they'll only do the procedure on teenagers who have a future in the sport.\n\n\"You're doing a surgery to get a kid a free education, or helping him as a professional prospect,\" Waslewski said.\n\nOtherwise, he said, the surgery is largely unnecessary. A torn UCL isn't the end of the world unless you're trying to throw 95 mph.\n\n\"You can do everything in life except throw a baseball at maximum velocity,\" he said.\n\nWaslewski said if a teenage baseball player has the right mindset coming back from Tommy John surgery, he can thrive. Compton was one of those players, attacking the rehab with passion as he worked to get on the field with Arizona State.\n\n\"I can focus on eating well, stretching, lifting,\" Compton said. \"Doing everything I can to be as good as I can a year from now. I'm super fortunate to be here.\"\n\nThough he's still working to come back as a pitcher, Compton's already found a niche as Arizona State's starting designated hitter, with a team-high .429 batting average and four homers in 14 games.\n\n\"It's almost a gift,\" Compton said. \"You've had a year off to focus on development that you wouldn't get if you were on the field every day. You get to build good life habits and that you can't take this game for granted.\"\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "title": "US lawmakers see TikTok as China's tool, even as it distances itself from Beijing - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- If some U.S. lawmakers have their way, the United States and China could end up with something in common: TikTok might not be available in either country.\n\nThe House on Wednesday approved a bill requiring the Beijing-based company ByteDance to sell its subsidiary TikTok or face a nationwide ban. It's unclear if the bill will ever become law, but it reflects lawmakers' fears that the social media platform could expose Americans to Beijing's malign influences and data security risks.\n\nBut while U.S. lawmakers associate TikTok with China, the company, headquartered outside China, has strategically kept its distance from its homeland.\n\nSince its inception, the TikTok platform has been intended for non-Chinese markets and is unavailable in mainland China. It pulled out of Hong Kong in 2020 when Beijing imposed a national security law on the territory to curtail speech. As data security concerns started to rise in the U.S., TikTok sought to reassure lawmakers that data gathered on U.S. users stays in the country and is inaccessible to ByteDance employees in Beijing.\n\nTikTok's parent company is following the same playbook as many other Chinese companies with global ambitions: To win customers and trust in the United States and other Western countries, they are playing down their Chinese roots and connections. Some have insisted they be called \"global companies\" instead of \"Chinese companies.\"\n\nBut for TikTok, this may not be enough. The House bill passed overwhelmingly on a 352-65 vote. Its prospects in the Senate are uncertain, but if it clears both chambers, President Joe Biden said he would sign it into law. The moves in Washington threaten the app's survival and cast a spotlight on the quandary that many private Chinese companies have found themselves a part of as they seek to engage Western markets at a time of souring U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"It's the most difficult time for Chinese tech companies and private businesses in decades as tensions and rivalry between the United States and China continue to grow,\" said Zhiqun Zhu, professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell University.\n\n\"These companies and businesses face squeezing from both sides as they struggle to survive,\" Zhu said. \"While the U.S. and other Western countries have imposed sanctions or restrictions on these companies, China itself has moved to favor state-owned enterprises in recent years, leaving little room for Chinese tech and private businesses to operate.\"\n\nAlex Capri, senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore and research fellow at Hinrich Foundation, agreed that companies like TikTok with Chinese roots are \"really stuck in two polar extremes\" between the heavy-handed communist party and the deeply suspicious West.\n\n\"Any Chinese tech company has to operate under a cloud of suspicion, and that's because there's a total breakdown of trust,\" Capri said.\n\nWith the rise of techno-nationalism, by which technological capabilities are deemed a national strategic asset, China's tech companies are obligated by Beijing's laws and rules to turn over data and have become \"essentially a de-facto representative\" of China's ruling communist party, Capri said.\n\n\"That in itself makes it very challenging for companies like TikTok,\" he said.\n\nIn 2018, Zhang Yiming, the founder of ByteDance, toed the party line after Beijing shut down ByteDance's jokes app. He apologized publicly for his company's deviations from socialistic core values and promised to \"comprehensively rectify the algorithm\" on its news app and add significantly more layers of censoring -- a move considered necessary for any company to survive in China.\n\nThat explains the oft-repeated claim by Rep. Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select Committee on China's communist party, that \"there's no such thing as a private company in China.\"\n\nThe bill, as approved by the House, seeks to remove applications from app stores or web hosting services in the U.S. unless the application severs its ties to companies -- such as ByteDance -- that are subject to the control from foreign adversaries, like China.\n\n\"This is my message to TikTok: Break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,\" said Gallagher, the bill's sponsor. \"America's foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States. TikTok's time in the United States is over unless it ends its relationship with CCP-controlled ByteDance.\"\n\nCongressional mistrust of TikTok was evident at a Jan. 31 hearing when Sen. Tom Cotton repeatedly asked CEO Shou Zi Chew if he is a Chinese citizen beholden to the Communist party. Chew, who is Singaporean, repeatedly said no.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi said it's problematic that ByteDance, which owns the social platform's algorithm, is subject to Beijing's control.\n\nChew, in another congressional hearing last year, told Congress that \"we do not remove or promote content on behalf of the Chinese government.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Wired magazine, Chew acknowledged that the company's Chinese origins have given TikTok a \"bigger trust deficit than most other companies.\"\n\n\"Maybe our trust starting line is behind other businesses, but I also think that there are very serious approaches that we've taken to try and earn that trust and to close that gap,\" Chew said, citing efforts by TikTok to protect U.S. user data, be transparent and \"not be manipulated by any government.\"\n\nShort of severance from the home country, Chinese companies chasing global ambitions have tried to distance themselves from China by introducing many foreign investors, hiring foreign executives, moving headquarters to outside China and limiting operations to overseas markets, said Thomas Zhang, China analyst at FrontierView, a U.S.-headquartered market intelligence provider. But \"the effects are limited as long as the founder in China does not relinquish control,\" Zhang said.\n\nFor TikTok, the trust is so lacking that even a full divestiture from its Chinese parent company may not work, because complicated ownership structures can obscure potential Chinese ownership, Capri said.\n\nAs TikTok fights for survival, it has made a move that is very present in American politics: It's engaging in heavy lobbying, and appealing to its 170 million U.S. users to contact their lawmakers to say a TikTok ban would infringe on their free speech rights.\n\nIt's won over one powerful critic: Former President Donald Trump, in a reversal, came out against the TikTok legislation. But Trump, for all his sway with congressional Republicans, couldn't prevent House passage.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, Capri said, TikTok could pursue the ultimate American recourse: a lawsuit to challenge the ban.",

        "title": "The suddenly surging Buffalo Sabres have inched their way back into playoff race with 8-3-1 run - WTOP News",
        "body": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Someone evidently forgot to inform Dylan Cozens and the Buffalo Sabres that they were out of playoff contention when falling 12 points out of the race a month ago.\n\nThen again, Cozens wouldn't have accepted the notion even if someone had.\n\n\"Our belief is higher than ever right now,\" Cozens said after scoring in a 4-0 win over the New York Islanders on Thursday night. \"I think I said it a month ago, maybe weeks ago, that we still believe in this room that we can do it. And that's what we're doing right now.\"\n\nFrom dropping to 13th place in the Eastern Conference standings -- and sitting closer to last than eighth -- following a 4-3 loss to Anaheim on Feb. 19, the Sabres are enjoying a remarkable resurgence. They've gone 8-3-1 since and closed to within three points of the Islanders and Detroit Red Wings in the race for the conference's final wild-card spot.\n\nCozens said one difference is Sabres players feeling more loose after spending much of the first part of the season carrying the weight of expectations to end what stands as an NHL-record 13-season playoff drought.\n\n\"I think if we're gonna go down, we're gonna go down with a fight. We're going to play like we honestly have nothing to lose,\" he said. \"We obviously know there's a lot to lose, but we can't talk about that when we're out on the ice.\"\n\nSuddenly, the shortcomings -- slow starts, a three-goalie rotation, injuries and the inability to win more than two in a row -- that swamped the Sabres over the first four months of the season appear to have been resolved.\n\nAnd keep in mind, Buffalo's last three wins, including a 3-2 shootout victory over Edmonton on Saturday, followed the team trading its captain, Kyle Okposo, to Florida, and trading it's top scorer, center Casey Mittelstadt, to Colorado in a deal for offensive defenseman Bowen Byram.\n\n\"I think I'll answer that one after we keep responding,\" coach Don Granato said, when asked about his reshuffled roster. \"We just have to keep responding so it's on to the next game. ... But to this point, yes, I think the energy's really good.\"\n\nThough the Sabres have yet to win four in a row, they're enjoying their second 3-0 run in three weeks.\n\nFor a team that still struggles to score the opening goal, Buffalo has opened the scoring in each of its past two, including a four-goal first-period eruption in a 7-3 rout of Detroit on Tuesday.\n\nAnd most significantly, the Sabres are riding a hot goalie in Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, who has gone 16-8-1 with four shutouts and 45 goals allowed in his past 25 outings since claiming the starting job in late December.\n\n\"It's enjoyable to watch because it's been a build,\" Granato said, in referring to both Luukkonen and rookie Devon Levi, who is now developing in the minors.\n\n\"It's something we've been tactically building for, is we took two young goalies into this organization, Levi and Upie, and we've made a commitment to two young goalies to develop them at the NHL level and that's not a common thing to do,\" he added. \"So, it's a good feeling when you see them progress the way they did.\"\n\nThere seemed nothing tactical about the plan when the Sabres opened the season banking on Levi to take over the reins, and with Luukkonen not getting his first start until Levi and backup Eric Comrie sustained injuries. And Granato's comments seem to deflect from the Sabres being second-guessed for carrying three goalies -- and taking up a valuable roster spot -- before finally demoting Levi to the minors in January.\n\nEither way, Luukkonen is dominating in his second full NHL season, and after he struggled during Buffalo's late-season playoff push last year.\n\n\"It means a lot, kind of finding my footing in the net and kind of proving to myself, too, that I'm an NHL-caliber goalie and I can handle the starts,\" Luukkonen said.\n\nThe key is maintaining focus.\n\n\"Once you kind of lose sight of the next game and start to think too far ahead, you really don't do any favors for yourself,\" he said. \"I think it's just kind of knowing what we've been doing right and trusting that.\"\n\nWith 15 games remaining, the Sabres still have a hill to climb with the team embarking on a five-game road trip which opens at Detroit on Saturday.\n\nCozens recalled how the Sabres closed last season going 9-2-1 only to fall two points short of a playoff berth.\n\n\"We knew what we did last year and found a way to get close. And I think, last year, we kind of let the outside noise make us think we were out of it,\" Cozens said. \"And that's something we've learned this year. Don't worry about the outside noise, just just worry about this dressing room.\"\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Mindestens zwei Tote und Schäden durch Tornados in den USA",
        "body": "Indianapolis (dpa) - Heftige Wirbelstürme und Tornados haben in den USA mindestens zwei Menschen das Leben gekostet und erhebliche Schäden angerichtet. Betroffen waren vor allem die Bundesstaaten Indiana, Ohio und Kentucky, wie örtliche Medien berichteten. Es gebe mehr als 20 Verletzte, meldete CNN. Innerhalb weniger Stunden wurden laut dem Sender ABC News am Abend mindestens acht Tornados gezählt.\n\nZwei Menschen seien in Lakeview (Ohio), rund 200 Kilometer nördlich von Dayton, in einer Siedlung von Mobilheimen (transportable Häuser) im Sturm getötet worden, teilte Sheriff Randall Dodds Medienberichten zufolge in der Nacht mit. \"Der Schaden hier ist einfach unglaublich\", zitierte ihn der Sender NBC News.\n\nSchwere Verwüstungen\n\n\"Es ist die reine Verwüstung\", sagte die Vorsitzende der örtlichen Handelskammer in Lakeview, Amber Fagan, dem Sender ABC 6 News. \"So etwas habe ich in meinem ganzen Leben noch nicht gesehen. Unser Gemeindegebäude ist zerstört, unser Waschsalon ist weg\", ergänzte sie. Auf Fotos in Lokalmedien waren abgedeckte Häuser und umgeknickte Bäume zu sehen.\n\nIn der Kleinstadt Winchester (Indiana) habe es \"viele, viele schwere Verletzungen\" gegeben, sagte ein Polizeisprecher. Genaue Zahlen konnte er nicht nennen. Zuvor hatte es Berichte von mindestens drei Toten dort gegeben. Dies konnte der Sprecher aber nicht bestätigen. Ein genaueres Bild der Lage werde erst möglich sein, wenn eingestürzte Gebäude untersucht worden seien.\n\nIm Bezirk Randolph, wo auch Winchester liegt, seien zudem ein Supermarkt und ein Schnellrestaurant zerstört worden, berichteten örtliche Medien. In der rund 750 Einwohner zählenden Ortschaft Selma, rund 25 Kilometer westlich, habe der Sturm etwa 50 Prozent aller Bauten beschädigt, teilte der Katastrophenschutz mit. Glücklicherweise habe es dort nur einige Leichtverletzte gegeben.\n\nAuch aus der Ortschaft Milton (Kentucky) gab es Berichte von mindestens 50 durch Stürme beschädigte Gebäude.\n\nVielerorts Stromausfälle\n\nWegen beschädigter Leitungen sei auch vielerorts der Strom ausgefallen, hieß es in den Berichten weiter. Laut der Seite Poweroutage.us waren in Indiana, Ohio und Kentucky am Freitagmorgen rund 50.000 Haushalte ohne Elektrizität. Viele Schulen blieben am Freitag geschlossen.\n\nBereits am Mittwoch hatten schwere Stürme die Bundesstaaten Kansas und Missouri getroffen. Mancherorts fiel Hagel - mit Klumpen so groß wie ein Baseball. US-Medien sprachen von \"Gorilla-Hagel\". Colorado erlebte derweil heftige Schneefälle.\n\nExperten führen die Häufung von Naturkatastrophen in den USA - Stürme, Überflutungen und Waldbrände - auch auf die Folgen des Klimawandels zurück.\n\n© dpa-infocom, dpa:240315-99-347462/4",

        "title": "Illinois will be title hunting in Minneapolis",
        "body": "CHAMPAIGN -- Illinois will step onto the court at the Target Center for the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals Friday evening without the doubts of a bubble team.\n\nThere's no \"win and you're in\" pressure. The Illini are a lock for the NCAA tournament regardless of how Friday's game plays out. Same for any subsequent tournament game in Minneapolis.\n\nAll of the current bracketology projections have No. 13 Illinois (23-8) firmly on the No. 4 seed line for the NCAA tournament. A team like McNeese State or Samford a likely opponent somewhere -- likely not all that close to home -- in the first round.\n\nBrad Underwood doesn't know how much his team can improve its NCAA tournament résumé this week in Minneapolis. The upside is the Illini will almost assuredly play only Quad I or Quad II games at the Target Center. No chance to take a bad loss. But also maybe not enough of an opportunity to climb to the No. 3 seed line, which projects as Illinois' NCAA tournament ceiling.\n\n\"I don't worry too much about it in terms of the seeding,\" Underwood said. \"We've got 16s beating 1s now, so it's truly a crap shoot. I did get to see a lot of teams in some of the lower leagues -- I truly appreciate those conference championships and games -- and a lot of good teams. ... Selection Sunday is what it is. We'll figure out where we're at and where we're going.\"\n\nUnderwood has kept up a running dialogue with his team since last fall about how a season-long résumé is built. He discussed the importance of not taking a bad loss. There was also discussion about the importance of the margin of victory and how pushing for 40 minutes in games the Illini should win was vital.\n\n\"Coach does a great job not harping over it, but he speaks on it time to time and let's us know it's important,\" Illinois guard Ty Rodgers said. \"The older guys relay that message to the younger guys.\"\n\nThe likely ups and downs of a 20-game Big Ten schedule were also a pertinent topic of conversation. Illinois had both during the regular season. The home loss to Maryland qualifies as a bad loss now that it's settled back in Quad III territory. A 5-6 record in Quad I games meant a combination of good wins and some missed opportunities.\n\n\"You've got to talk about those things,\" Underwood said. \"We don't shy away from them. This group has to understand the abruptness of the end.\"\n\nThe end of Marcus Domask's college basketball career is coming. Just like it is for Terrence Shannon Jr., Quincy Guerrier and Justin Harmon. Those four have just two guaranteed games remaining.\n\n\"It's just us kind of understanding the situation,\" Domask said. \"It's that time. It's March. Every game means so much -- especially now with tournament play.\n\n\"The only thing that matters is if you win or not. I don't have a ring yet in college. I'm looking to get one any way possible.\"\n\nThat's the mindset Illinois will take into the Big Ten tournament. The plan is three games in three days. A chance to win a second conference tournament in four years. Have its on-court celebration lead right into the Selection Show just like it did in 2021 when Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn led the Illini to their first Big Ten tournament title since 2005.\n\nUnderwood knows three wins in three days in Minneapolis might not have any effect on what seed the Illini get for the NCAA tournament or where the committee sends them for the first round. A No. 4 seed heading into the tournament might be a No. 4 seed coming out of it.\n\nBut three wins in three days is still the goal even amidst the grumbling from Big Ten fans has started to question the wisdom of that level of exertion when the conference as a whole hasn't won a national championship since 2000.\n\n\"I'm playing to win,\" Underwood said. \"I'm playing to win every (darn) game we go out and play. You can say it doesn't mean anything and the NCAA tournament is the NCAA tournament. As long as we're playing games that the jersey on the other side says a different university and it's a different color, we're trying to play to win.\n\n\"I don't buy all the rest and this and that. I'm there to play to win. I would love to be standing on a ladder trying to cut down a net on Sunday and then try to go do it again.\"",

Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn had 16 points and nine rebounds apiece, Andre Curbelo chipped in 16 points, six rebounds and five assists off the bench and the Illini topped the Buckeyes 91-88 in overtime to win the tournament title. That was the first tournament meeting for the two teams since Ohio State's 88-81 double overtime win in 2010 in Indianapolis.\n\nBeat writer Scott Richey's storylinesDomask deserving of postseason honors\n\nBrad Underwood couldn't anticipate that Marcus Domask would turn into an All-Big Ten First Team-level player in his first season in the conference. Sure, Domask was one of the best players in the Missouri Valley Conference for the duration of his Southern Illinois career, but it was still a jump in level to the Big Ten. \"I think every player's mental ability to handle change is different,\" Underwood said. \"We liked his talent. We knew he would be a good player. You've got to have team success, in my opinion, to be worthy of First Team all-conference awards. He's been a big piece of that. We've kind of had three seasons in one with (Terrence Shannon Jr.'s suspension), and Marcus was steady through all of that and has found a great niche. He's a tremendous teammate and a tremendous worker, and he deserves it.\"\n\nLess of a case for defensive honors?\n\nA year ago at this time, Underwood expressed real displeasure that Coleman Hawkins had been left off the All-Big Ten Defensive Team. Said he was \"devastated\" with the versatile 6-foot-10 forward's exclusion. Another round of Big Ten awards passed Tuesday. Hawkins was again not an All-Big Ten Defensive Team selection. This time around Hawkins wasn't surprised and went into depth Wednesday about why. \"This year I was guarding bigs, and there's no bigs in our league that can shoot besides (Nebraska's) Rienk Mast,\" Hawkins said. \"I was in the paint the whole time. If we were able to switch one through five, I think I'd be able to showcase my defensive skills more, which we did a little bit more in the first half of the season. Half the time, I'm just down there (in the post), and they're really quick to call fouls. When you see guys get jump hooks in there, it's because all I can do is wall up and not be really aggressive. I wish I could be more aggressive, but they're quick to call fouls, and I feel like I'm an important piece. If I get two fouls in the first half and sit out a whole first half, it just messes with me mentally and is not very good for our team.\"\n\nIllini have plenty of offensive options\n\nIllinois had three players put up a 30-point performance this season in Shannon (four times), Domask (three times) and Hawkins (once). Nearly a fourth with Quincy Guerrier dropping 28 points in the early December loss at Tennessee. Justin Harmon had a 20-point performance against Northwestern, and Ty Rodgers went for 15 twice in Big Ten play against Michigan and Michigan State. The Illini have options offensively. \"It definitely takes the pressure off,\" Domask said. \"There's not one person on the team that has to feel the need to score 25 a game. One guy could have an off night and get picked up by the other four guys on the court.I think it just helps us play naturally and not feel like we have to force anything and just play fluidly.\"\n\nThe News-Gazette's pickNo. 13 Illinois 86, Ohio State 76\n\nOhio State went on an incredible run after Chris Holtmann was fired and to interim coach Jake Diebler took control. The Buckeyes aren't likely to pull a Texas and give Diebler the job moving forward, but he's at least made himself a head coach candidate elsewhere across the country as the coaching carousel continues to spin. And that's where Ohio State's attention will be after Friday night when that run ends in the Big Ten tournament quarterfinals against Illinois. The Illini's 12-point regular season win in Columbus, Ohio, wasn't a fluke. (N-G prediction record: 27-4)",

        "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C.: On March 8, U.S. District Judge Mary K. Dimke rejected a challenge to a Washington state law, one of three bills signed by Democratic Governor Jay Inslee in 2023 to address gun violence, that allows for lawsuits against the gun industry in certain circumstances.\n\nThe new law requires the industry to exercise reasonable controls in making, selling, and marketing weapons, including preventing guns from being sold to people known to be dangerous or to straw buyers.\n\nIt also allows attorneys-general or private parties, such as family members of shooting victims, to sue for violations or damages under the state's Consumer Protection Act.\n\nTrade association the National Shooting Sports Foundation challenged the law in U.S. District Court in Spokane, claiming that the measure violates the Second Amendment and the free-speech rights of its members.\n\nJudge Dimke said the organization had not established legal standing to challenge the measure and noted that its members were neither being sued under the law nor had expressed an intent to violate its terms.\n\nIn a news release, Democratic Attorney-General Bob Ferguson, who is running for governor, said, \"This law protects Washingtonians from gun violence by ensuring that gun industry members face real accountability when their irresponsible conduct harms our communities.\"\n\nCongress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005 to protect the gun industry from liability in some circumstances. However, Ferguson said states are allowed to create exemptions.\n\nWashington, Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and California are exempt from that federal law.",

        "title": "Running backs had plenty of options this week, even if the position still faces challenges - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- A year after his position was in crisis, Derrick Henry still feels a bond with his fellow running backs.\n\nAnd this was a week he could enjoy.\n\n\"I was definitely happy to see those guys go off the market pretty fast. I think that speaks volumes that the running back position is still needed, even though it doesn't seem like it,\" Henry, one of several free agent backs who found new teams in the past few days, said Thursday. \"You still have to be able to run the ball. You still have to have a guy who can change the game in any matter of the game. I feel like the guys who signed those contracts are guys that can do that, and I think it was recognized.\"\n\nBeing a running back still isn't all that lucrative compared to other positions, but this year some of the game's best rushers enjoyed something you can't put a price on -- the freedom to move. Henry left a last-place Tennessee team to join one of the NFL's top rushing attacks in Baltimore.\n\nSaquon Barkley went from the New York Giants to Philadelphia's potentially dynamic offense. Tony Pollard joined the Titans to replace Henry, and Josh Jacobs moved from Las Vegas to a playoff team in Green Bay.\n\nBarkley, Pollard and Jacobs all received the franchise tag last season, postponing their shot to test the free market by a year.\n\nThe inability of those three players to secure long-term contracts last year underscored how the league has handled running backs of late. They're not viewed as great investments beyond a rookie contract, and the franchise tag at running back carries the lowest value of any position besides kicker and punter.\n\nHenry organized a group chat among top players at the position last summer. Indianapolis star Jonathan Taylor requested a trade, but eventually he and the Colts agreed on a three-year extension with $26.5 million guaranteed.\n\nBarkley's new deal is similar -- three years and $26 million guaranteed. He said guaranteed money was a priority for obvious reasons.\n\n\"I don't think it's just important for just the running back position. I think for any player in the NFL, it's important to get the most guaranteed money that you can,\" Barkley said. \"We play in the NFL. Not just the running backs, but everybody. It's a gruesome sport. You never know what can happen in this game.\"\n\nHenry, who at age 30 is three years older than Barkley, received $9 million guaranteed in his two-year deal with the Ravens. What those two backs have in common is that both joined contenders they can presumably flourish with. Jacobs made a similar move, going to the up-and-coming Packers.\n\nPollard went from the NFC East champion Dallas Cowboys to the Titans, but he's from Tennessee and played in college at Memphis.\n\n\"It was just perfect timing. Everything just worked out the way it should,\" Pollard said. \"I'm very familiar with the area, got a lot of family out here, so it made sense for me.\"\n\nPollard sounded like he was happy his brief time as a free agent was over.\n\n\"It was a little stressful, but I'm glad I'm not on the market anymore,\" Pollard said. \"I'm glad I found a home.\"\n\nRegardless of how much money is available for running backs, free agency lets players find a good fit for themselves, which can be a priority in its own right. Austin Ekeler went from the Los Angeles Chargers to Washington, and Aaron Jones from Green Bay to Minnesota.\n\nSo far, this offseason for running backs is starting with a lot less angst than 2023.\n\n\"Definitely want to be able to have a market where it's fair, and we are valued,\" Henry said. \"For the future, as well, for the guys that are coming up after us.\"\n\nJones gets fresh start, Cousins out\n\nThe NFL is never a more fast-moving business than in March, as Jones was fully part of this week.\n\nThe Packers publicly declared their desire to bring him back for an eighth season in green and gold, but as is often the case in this league, they were ultimately only willing to do so at their price.\n\nReleased on Monday -- when the Packers were working on a new deal with his replacement, 2022 All-Pro Josh Jacobs -- Jones had a contract with the Vikings by the next morning.\n\nAs he took questions from reporters about the switch to Green Bay's fiercest rival, following the path blazed by Ryan Longwell, Brett Favre, Greg Jennings and Za'Darius Smith among others, Jones deftly avoided dropping any hint of bitterness toward his former team like he was dodging tacklers on the field. He kept his focus squarely on Minnesota, raving about how the organization had treated him and his family upon arrival.\n\n\"It's not strange at all. It's football,\" Jones said. \"You change teams and you change teammates. That's part of the game.\"\n\nLike Jones, the Vikings themselves were in the nascent stage of their fresh start at quarterback after the departure of Kirk Cousins for Atlanta.\n\n\"We've been very clear that we think we could win a Super Bowl with Kirk Cousins, but we have a sport that only gets you a certain number of draft picks, a salary cap, competition versus other teams. It's a resource-constrained thing, so we don't get the chance to just say, binary, yes or no,\" GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defenseâs contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.\n\n(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington and Aaron Ross in Nairobi; Editing by Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "'This win is big for us'",
        "body": "URBANA -- Emotions ran high on Thursday afternoon as the Urbana baseball team opened its season with a 5-3 win against Heritage at Prairie Park.\n\nLike when the Tigers' bench was issued a warning for language after senior catcher Jaydon Riggs tied the game 1-1 with a two-out solo home run over the left-center field fence in the bottom of the first inning.\n\nRiggs was a freshman 1,043 days ago when Urbana played its last varsity baseball game before scaling back to a junior varsity schedule in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\"That was the last few years, this past offseason, all the hard work, late nights, early mornings,\" Riggs said. \"All that came out a little bit. I need to control that next time.\"\n\nRiggs' home run -- which helped the Tigers overcome a leadoff triple from Zaien Smith a half-inning prior -- was Urbana's first varsity run since the Tigers fell to Centennial in an 18-3 Class 3A regional semifinal loss on June 4, 2021.\n\nIt's something the Tigers (1-0) have thought plenty about during the past two seasons.\n\n\"This year there's a lot more excitement around it,\" Urbana junior Gabe Daniels said.\n\n\"There's a lot more support for it,\" Daniels continued. \"Last year, we were kind of the laughingstock of the school versus this year. Now that Jaydon and I have kind of gotten our names out there a little bit more, there's less of a bad attitude towards it.\"\n\nHeritage (0-2) took its second lead of the game in the top of the second inning when Destin Nickle and Jaden White drew walks to lead off the frame, allowing Smith to drive in Nickle with a one-out single. A pair of strikeouts from Urbana starter Dylan Pettit followed to help the Tigers dance out of trouble.\n\n\"It starts with the pitchers,\" Urbana assistant coach Andre Montgomery said. \"It's how they can control and compose themselves. Dylan did a great job and Gabe did a great job of backing us up, and when we weren't getting strikes, we didn't make too many errors in the field.\"\n\nIn the bottom of the second inning, a dropped third strike eluded White behind the plate and allowed Urbana's Jaiden Anindo to advance to second base with one out.\n\nPettit singled and both came around to score in the inning, aided by a double from Nico Wiemelt. Urbana never trailed again on a cloudy afternoon.\n\n\"Our guys rally behind the pitchers,\" Montgomery said. \"They kept talking to them. They kept encouraging them. I think it was an all-out effort with confidence and encouraging each other.\"\n\nDaniels singled and scored during the third inning and Wiemelt singled and scored in the fourth to ensure the Tigers' edge.\n\nDaniels struck out three batters and surrendered a run during the final two innings after Pettit struck out six and yielded four walks in three innings of work.\n\n\"I feel like I did better than I thought I would have,\" Daniels said. \"I was able to keep my thoughts calmer. I was able to control the game. I wish I could have commanded a little better on the mound because my breaking balls weren't there. So it was just a fastball and curveball.\"\n\nThe last three outs didn't come easily for Daniels, who surrendered a single to Hayden Davis before walking Miller and Klayton Junglas to load the bases.\n\nA balk scored Davis before Daniels recovered and struck out Nickle and White as the sky grew too dark to continue without lights at Prairie Park.\n\n\"I just got kind of mad, then I just started going from there,\" Daniels said. \"I don't know, but I feel like when I'm angry, I pitch better.\"\n\nUrbana's defense helped the winning cause with just one error.\n\nMontgomery and fellow assistant Lawrence Davis -- leading the Tigers in the absence of head coach Brandon McFarland -- emphasized mental toughness throughout the game, repeatedly telling the Tigers to play without emotion after defensive mistakes or unsuccessful at-bats.\n\n\"We played really well defensively and that's going to be key for us to get victories this season,\" Davis said. \"We might not have the strongest arms, but we've got the strongest heart and a nice strong work ethic.\"\n\nThe Hawks had some positive takeaways, too, after out-hitting the Tigers 7-6 and boasting a young core with just one senior after a 3-19 campaign in 2023.\n\n\"I think that we lacked the key hit this game,\" Heritage coach Andy Charles said. \"Not in one particular place but in several places. I thought we did a good job getting runners on base and running the bases fairly smart, but just that one hit short and that comes with time.\"\n\nUrbana's season-opening victory came two days after a 9-0 JV triumph against Paxton-Buckley-Loda, marking the second encouraging signal for the rebuilding program in the first week of the season.\n\nA challenging schedule ahead will have the Tigers host reigning regional champions St. Thomas More and Mahomet-Seymour on March 20 and 23 before traveling to Rantoul on March 25 and 27.\n\n\"This win is big for us,\" Davis said. \"It just really showed that we can compete with these guys. If we come here and work hard in practice, be consistent and get more patient, a little calmer out there, we can maybe shock some people in the Big 12 and win some games that technically we're supposed to lose.\"",

        "title": "College swimmers, volleyball players sue NCAA over transgender policies - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "ATLANTA -- Former Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines was among more than a dozen college athletes who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA on Thursday, accusing it of violating their Title IX rights by allowing Lia Thomas to compete at the national championships in 2022.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, details the shock Gaines and other swimmers felt when they learned they would have to share a locker room with Thomas at the championships in Atlanta. It documents a number of races they swam in with Thomas, including the 200-yard final in which Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth but Thomas, not Gaines, was handed the fifth-place trophy.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Tylor Mathieu of Florida, finished ninth in the preliminary heats of the 500 free, which left her one spot from swimming in the final that Thomas would go on to win. Thomas was the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title in any sport, finishing in front of three Olympic medalists for the championship. By not making the final, Mathieu was denied first-team All-American honors in that event.\n\nOther plaintiffs included athletes from volleyball and track.\n\nThe lawsuit said the plaintiffs \"bring this case to secure for future generations of women the promise of Title IX that is being denied them and other college women\" by the NCAA.\n\nThe NCAA declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nCritics contend transgender athletes have an advantage over cisgender women in competition, though extensive research is still generally lacking on elite athletics and virtually nonexistent when it comes to determining whether, for instance, a sophomore transgender girl has a clear advantage over her cisgender opponents or teammates.\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA followed the lead of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and revised its policies on transgender athlete participation to attempt to align with national sports governing bodies.\n\nThe third phase of the revised policy adds national and international sports governing body standards to the NCAA's rules and is scheduled to be implemented for the 2024-25 school year.\n\nThe lawsuit also lists the University of Georgia system as a defendant because one of its schools, Georgia Tech, hosted the 2022 championships. The suit seeks to halt the NCAA from employing its transgender eligibility policies \"which adversely impact female athletes in violation of Title IX\" at upcoming events being held in Georgia.\n\nRepresentatives from the Georgia schools said they had not been served with the lawsuit and would not comment.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defense's contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.\n\n(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington and Aaron Ross in Nairobi; Editing by Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "'It was the life raft': Transgender people find a safe haven in Florida's capital city",
        "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Quandarius \"Chanel\" Johnson twirled a gold-colored crown that glinted with light streaming in from a nearby window. It's a symbol to remind her of her strength. After all, \"I'm a Leo,\" Johnson said.\n\nShe keeps the crown hanging on her bedpost. Johnson, a Black transgender woman, lives in a safe house not far from the Florida Capitol, where lawmakers in recent years have placed new restrictions on transgender people, as have legislators in other Republican-dominated states. Last spring, for example, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a new law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors, and another barring transgender people from using the restroom that matches their gender identity.\n\nTucked in a quiet neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Florida's capital city, the four-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot house with a brick archway and shrub-lined walkway is just 5 miles from the capitol building. But it offers a sanctuary -- albeit a limited one -- from the transgender debates roiling the Florida legislature.\n\nLaunched by Capital Tea, a local transgender outreach nonprofit, it opened in December 2022 and has five resident beds plus another bed for emergency stays. The money to run it comes from foundations and nonprofits concerned about violence against LGBTQ+ people, said director Janel Diaz.\n\nTransgender and gender-nonconforming adults are more likely to be homeless, with many of them kicked out of their homes by disapproving relatives, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. About 1 in 5 transgender people have experienced homelessness at some point, the National Center for Transgender Equality reports, and Black people make up a disproportionate number of them.\n\n\"When I came out to my family, I was kicked out of my house, too,\" said Diaz, who is transgender. Then 18, she lived on the streets for a year. \"To some people that might seem not a lot. But for me, it seemed like an eternity.\"\n\nResidents can stay for up to a year at Capital Tea's safe house, which is reserved for transgender women. This summer, Diaz said, the group plans to open a house for transgender men. She hopes to grow the program beyond Florida and create a model program for other states and cities.\n\n\"I want it to be to where it is not just Tallahassee-based,\" Diaz said. \"I want Capital Tea to be the Underground Railroad of trans housing.\"\n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, where gender-affirming health care for youth is now illegal under state law, My Sistah's House offers a shelter for transgender women. Tennessee, like Florida, is GOP-dominated, but similar homes exist in Democratic-controlled states.\n\nA ministry group runs the R&R Space in Michigan; a group of Republican lawmakers in that state last month discussed banning transgender health care for everyone.\n\nOther examples include a transitional housing program run by the Transgender Emergency Fund of Massachusetts, and one run by the TransLatin Coalition in Los Angeles.\n\nThe issue of housing resonates throughout transgender communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a series of reports on transgender women, HIV disparities and housing. Among 1,566 transgender women, 31% reported being homeless for between a month and a year. In addition, more than half of transgender women who reported being evicted or denied housing due to their gender identity also reported being homeless for that amount of time.\n\nElle Lett, a University of Washington School of Public Health statistician-epidemiologist, who is a Black and trans woman, has researched the issue.\n\n\"Trans people are subjected to interpersonal and structural discrimination that often leaves them unhoused, without social supports, and these things are exacerbated by other intersecting systems of oppression like racism and ableism,\" said Lett, who is also a medical school student at the University of Pennsylvania. \"They have a lot working against them.\"\n\nPublic health experts note that housing and well-being are closely linked. Christopher AhnAllen, director of inpatient psychology at Brigham & Women's Hospital and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said places such as the Capital Tea home \"create spaces of love and joy and wellness that are essential to contrast the hostility and hate that may exist in other spaces.\"\n\nThe house in Tallahassee is decked out with contemporary-style furniture -- velvet gray sofas, pink candles and tall lamps that glow different colors. Heavy incense wafts through the air. A rec room closet has a stack of board games and donations of clothes and toiletries.\n\nJohnson, who has HIV, receives health care from a local clinic for low-income HIV patients. But she doesn't know how she will pay for her upcoming medical transition.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, she had more pressing concerns on her mind. Johnson and her housemate Jae Cancel had just finished tidying for incoming residents, and Diaz announced that she was making a run to McDonald's.\n\nCancel, 20, has been homeless since they were 15. Cancel's mother kicked them out multiple times, shuffling the then-teen to their father's house, where they said they were beaten. Stateline agreed to use a pseudonym for this story and withheld Cancel's full name for their safety.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, before connecting with Capital Tea, Cancel got off the streets and was doing yard work for a homeowner in exchange for a room in an RV. The situation quickly deteriorated, however, and Cancel didn't feel safe.\n\nAfter Capital Tea saw Cancel's social media posts about the housing situation, Diaz and her team got them a hotel room before taking them to the local homeless shelter, where they shared a room with other homeless transgender youth until the Capital Tea house became ready at the end of the year.\n\n\"It was the life raft thrown when you least expect it,\" Cancel said.\n\nCancel shared a room and single bathroom with other trans residents at the homeless shelter, and was followed around the premises several times.\n\n\"Here [at the Capital Tea house], I know that I'm not going to be judged when I turn this corner, and I'm not going to be talked about,\" Cancel said. \"I'm able to really sit in silence and stillness.\"\n\nJohnson was 18 when she started wearing lashes and getting her hair done. But her family in rural Georgia rejected her transgender identity.\n\nAt 19, she moved to Tallahassee to get away. At 22, her mother died while Johnson was living with a roommate who didn't accept her identity and was \"toxic,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It had me in a low place,\" she said, her chin trembling, adding that living with her previous roommate \"felt like I was still being robbed of who I was as a person.\"\n\nShe met and befriended Diaz through local drag shows.\n\n\"I need to get out of this situation,\" Johnson said she told Diaz. \"She [Diaz] was like, 'Can you hold on, and I got you?' I did what I needed to do to maintain.\"\n\nOne day, Johnson got a phone call.\n\n\"I've got a surprise for you,\" Diaz told her. She picked Johnson up and brought her to the house. \"This is going to be where you'll be staying.\"\n\nJohnson said she sees herself and her housemates as a \"sisterhood.\"\n\n\"She didn't know me from a can of paint, but she knew I was connected to her in some type of way,\" she said about having Diaz as a mentor and \"second mom.\" \"She's been one person that has literally been in my corner.\"\n\nJohnson said she is relieved to have shelter.\n\n\"You can't box something that was never meant to fit in,\" she said.\n\nNada Hassanein is a health care reporter for Stateline with a focus on inequities.

        "title": "Tiny North Central enjoying moment at top of women's wrestling with change on horizon as sport grows - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "NAPERVILLE, Ill. -- Joe Norton was plenty busy leading a successful men's wrestling team at his alma mater when a conversation with his boss in the weight room changed things in a flash. Athletic director Jim Miller mentioned the school was adding women's bowling. Norton's response: Why not wrestling?\n\n\"I was like half joking,\" Norton said. \"But I was like what are we adding women's bowling for? And he said, you know, because we can get like a roster number of 10 to 12. And I said ... I'd get 40 women's wrestlers.\"\n\nNorton now oversees one of the nation's most successful programs in a growing sport poised for NCAA championship recognition as the women's wrestling coach at North Central College, a Division III school in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nThe program has ballooned in its five years from nine wrestlers to 51 from 23 states stretching from the East Coast to Alaska.\n\nFour from North Central have combined to capture six national titles since the program's inception, and six are scheduled to compete next month in the U.S. Olympic Team Trials at Penn State. The Cardinals finished second to Iowa in the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Championships after taking the top prize last year.\n\nWith programs from all divisions going against each other, North Central can say it's one of the best, period, and not just in Division III. That could change in the coming years, with participation increasing and the potential championship recognition by the NCAA.\n\nThe number of NCAA and NAIA schools as well as junior colleges with programs has leaped from 62 to 144 the past five years with individual participation growing from 935 to 2,641, according to the National Wrestling Coaches Association. The NCAA has seen about a threefold growth in that span, from 27 teams to 78 and 398 participants to 1,261 competing across all divisions.\n\nIt is clear what is feeding the boom: Girls' wrestling has become the fastest-growing high school sport in the country.\n\nThere were just a handful of programs when women's college wrestling began in the 1990s.\n\n\"We go to tournaments,\" said Maddie Avila, a national champion at 101 pounds in 2023. \"We see so many younger wrestlers there and it's so awesome and also motivating to just see the sport growing as a whole.\"\n\nThere still is room to grow.\n\nOpportunities in Division I remain scarce, with only four programs and one from a power conference: Iowa, which started competition this season. The other three are Lindenwood (Mo.), Presbyterian College and Sacred Heart.\n\nWith only a handful of options for recruits, North Central can attract the best prospects. But the landscape could change if more D-I and D-II schools -- with scholarships to offer -- start programs and women's wrestling becomes an NCAA championship sport.\n\nIn February, the NCAA Committee on Women's Athletics recommended Divisions I, II and III sponsor legislation to create a women's championship.\n\nMembers are expected to vote at the NCAA Convention in January. If it passes, the first championship could be in 2026. Wrestling would join rowing (1996), ice hockey (2000), water polo (2000), bowling (2003) and beach volleyball (2015) as the sixth to gain championship status through the Emerging Sports for Women program.\n\n\"We're just enjoying this moment in time knowing that it won't last forever,\" said Miller, who wrestled and played football at North Central in the 1980s and coached both sports at his alma mater.\n\nIf the NCAA adds enough teams to split into divisions, Norton is prepared to have his program settle in as a D-III powerhouse. But for now?\n\n\"I was selling dreams in 2019,\" said Norton, who also assists the men's team. \"Right now I'm selling this experience. Come and be on the No. 1 team in the country.\"\n\nIn a short period, a long line of All-Americans have passed through the steamy gym on the second floor of a fieldhouse built in 1930.\n\nThe Cardinals warm up by dividing into teams for games of Olympic-style handball that resemble football at times. Players drag each other to the mat as they try to prevent one another from tossing the ball into garbage pails serving as goals at each end of the gym.\n\nThey sweat through drills as Corey Hart's 1980s hit \"Sunglasses At Night\" blares on an endless loop on a recent afternoon. Other days, the music is more current.\n\nNorton, who wrestled at North Central just over a decade ago, cast a wide net when he started the women's program, particularly since the Illinois High School Association didn't sponsor girls wrestling until the 2021-22 academic year. It meant flying in recruits from all over the country.\n\nYelena Makoyed was hanging with friends at church the night she got the call from Norton. She didn't recognize the number but answered anyway.\n\n\"Joe didn't have much to brag about,\" said Makoyed, a three-time national champion at 170 pounds from the Sacramento area. \"He was just starting his program. But, man, I think it was just the energy, and he just caught me at a good time. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.\"\n\nAmanda Martinez got a similar feeling from Norton and assistant Zach Cook when she was transferring to North Central. Now an assistant coach for the Cardinals, she is scheduled to compete at the Olympic trials.\n\n\"They were starting a program because they wanted to -- vs. a lot of schools that had to have a women's program, you know?\" she said.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of U.S. President Joe Biden's key campaign messages, that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, is winning over fewer Black supporters and those without college degrees than other segments of his political base, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nWorries about political extremism and threats to democracy have emerged as among Americans' top concerns, following historic events including Republican former President Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Supreme Court's move to end the nationwide right to abortion and a surge in migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe online national poll of 4,094 respondents from March 7-13 showed Republicans and Democrats alike worry about America's democratic institutions and the prospect of highly partisan politicians pushing through policies most people don't want.\n\nTrump has continued to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, a view that a majority of Republicans have adopted, and which Biden has warned could corrode voters' faith in the democratic process.\n\nSome 65% of poll respondents - including 72% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans - said they were worried \"partisan state legislatures will overturn the popular vote\" in some states to support a presidential candidate. Remaining respondents said they were not worried or didn't answer the question.\n\nEven higher shares of each party said they feared \"partisan-dominated governments enacting unpopular laws.\"\n\nAbout two in five Republicans and two in five Democrats consider the other party to be an imminent threat to the United States, according to the new poll.\n\nWhile the concerns were broadly held across different demographic groups, subtle differences in views within America's closely divided electorate highlight a concern among Democrats that some of Biden's supporters - notably those who are Black or without college degrees - might lack motivation to turn out on Election Day.\n\nSome 57% of Biden supporters in the poll said they were backing him to stop Trump, compared to 30% who cited support for Biden, suggesting the campaign focus on fear is helping allay Democrats' turnout concerns. Trump faces four criminal trials, including two tied to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nBut there were potential warning signs for Democrats.\n\nBiden's Black supporters, who make up about a fifth of his political base, were considerably less likely than his white backers to respond in the poll that they were voting to stop Trump, 37% to 65%.\n\nBlack Democrats were also less likely than white Democrats to say they were worried about a presidential candidate stealing an election or partisan state legislatures overturning its results. Black voters in the U.S. have skewed heavily Democratic for decades.\n\nAmong Biden supporters without college degrees, 53% said they wanted to stop Trump, compared to 64% of those with degrees.\n\nTo be sure, Biden is also campaigning on messages that he has helped the U.S. economy and pledges to defend abortion rights. Nearly half of Biden's Black supporters said they support him for his policies, compared to about a third of his white supporters.\n\n\"Highlighting the failures of Donald Trump is certainly part of that equation, but so is reminding voters of President Biden's accomplishments and providing a positive vision for the future,\" said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist who serves as partner at ROKK Solutions.\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said the campaign sees supporters motivated by a wide array of issues.\n\nIn a sign of America's broad concerns about government, some 72% of Democrats - including about the same share of Black Democrats - said they worried about unelected officials interpreting laws that affect their lives.\n\nAn even larger share of Republicans - 78% - shared that worry, which has been a key plank in Trump's campaign message that a \"deep state\" of unelected bureaucrats is ignoring the will of the people.\n\nVoters of all stripes said crime was an important issue in the coming election, including 84% of Democrats and 91% of Republicans. Similar shares cited the economy as important.\n\nDemocrats were much more likely than Republicans - 86% to 61% - to cite as important the growing gap between wealthy and average Americans. A similar share of Democrats said climate change was an important issue, but only about 40% of Republicans shared that view.\n\nClose to nine in 10 Democrats in the poll said protecting abortion access in their state was an important issue, compared to roughly half of Republicans.\n\nSome 81% of Republicans in the poll selected \"immigration making life harder for native-born Americans\" as an important issue, compared to 41% of Democrats.\n\nTrump has campaigned with a message that he will increase deportations of immigrants without legal standing.\n\nThe issue was considered important by about half of Democratic respondents without a college degree, and by about half of Black and Hispanic Democrats, underscoring Biden's potential vulnerability on immigration.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online with a nationally-representative sample of 4,094 U.S. adults, and had a margin of error of 1.7%.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; additional reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Scott Malone, Deepa Babington and Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "Bears acquire WR Keenan Allen from Chargers for 4th-round pick",
        "body": "CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears made their biggest splash in free agency Thursday night, sending a fourth-round pick to the Los Angeles Chargers in exchange for wide receiver Keenan Allen, the teams announced.\n\nAllen, 31, is entering the final year of the four-year contract extension he signed in 2020 and is due a $5 million roster bonus Sunday. After declining to take a pay cut from the Chargers, he has a new home in the Bears' offense opposite wideout DJ Moore.\n\nAllen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, will reunite with wide receivers coach Chris Beatty, who coached the same position with the Chargers from 2021 to '23. Allen caught a career-high 108 passes last season and posted the second-best output of his 11-year career with 1,243 yards and seven touchdowns. It marked the sixth time in Allen's career that he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.\n\nChicago has four picks remaining in the draft (Nos. 1, 9, 75, and 122 via Philadelphia) after sending one of two fourth-round picks (No. 110) to the Chargers on Thursday.\n\n\"We're extremely excited to add Keenan to our team,\" Bears general manager Ryan Poles said. \"His body of work speaks for itself and we look forward to him elevating our offense.\"\n\nAfter catching passes from Justin Herbert over the past four seasons, Allen will be working with a new quarterback in 2024. Bears incumbent Justin Fields is set to enter his fourth NFL season while Chicago is expected to use the No. 1 pick on a quarterback, with USC's Caleb Williams the consensus top pick. Poles has intimated that he would be open to trading Fields this offseason, but as the first wave of free agency draws to a close, Fields, 25, remains on the Bears roster with over a month until the draft.\n\nLast month at the NFL combine, coach Matt Eberflus noted the priority of adding more players to Chicago's wide receiver room. Former Bears receiver Darnell Mooney signed a three-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons in free agency, leaving Moore, Velus Jones Jr., Tyler Scott and Nsimba Webster as the only receivers on the Bears' roster. Webster has spent the majority of his career in Chicago on the practice squad.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of depth there, first of all,\" Eberflus said last month. \"That's the first part. Adding some dynamic pieces there through free agency or through the draft potentially, so to me when you're trying to defend that, when you have a weapon at tight end and you have a weapon at the X receiver like DJ. When you add a piece or two to the other side, it really balances you out. It's hard to defend for sure.\"\n\nThe addition of Allen gives Chicago another bona fide star at wide receiver. He is coming off his fifth season with 100 receptions, which is tied for the third most in NFL history, trailing only Antonio Brown and Brandon Marshall. Allen also holds the record for most games with 15 receptions (3) and ranks fourth all time for most games with 10 receptions. He had four games with 10 receptions last season, tied for the second most in the NFL.\n\nAllen is the third skill player the Bears have added on offense this week, along with former Chargers tight end Gerald Everett, who agreed to a two-year contract, and running back D'Andre Swift, who signed a three-year, $24 million contract Thursday.\n\nAllen was among four Chargers players who entered the offseason with cap hits upwards of $30 million next season, along with outside linebackers Khalil Mack and Joey Bosa and wide receiver Mike Williams, whom the team released Wednesday, saving $20 million this year. The players represented four of the five highest non-quarterback cap hits in the NFL.\n\nAllen's departure always seemed unlikely, though. He was the longest-tenured player on the Chargers, drafted by the team in the third round in 2013. He has the franchise records for yards and receptions by a receiver. Most important, Allen had perhaps the best season of his career in 2023. Despite missing the final four games with a heel injury, he set the Chargers' single-season record for receptions and was the most reliable weapon in a receiving corps that was inconsistent throughout the season.\n\n\"What Keenan Allen has meant to the Chargers for more than a decade cannot adequately be expressed through mere words,\" Chargers owner Dean Spanos said in a prepared statement Thursday night. \"There will only be one Keenan Allen, and we cannot thank him enough for the contributions he has made to our organization both on and off the field.\"\n\nIn January, Allen was the most vocal among the Chargers' stars about wanting to stay in Los Angeles. Mack said he understood that the NFL was a business, Bosa never spoke publicly about his future and Williams said he wanted to return, but didn't do so as emphatically as Allen.\n\n\"I don't want to go nowhere else,\" Allen said then. \"I've been here 10 years, like you said, the longest guy on the team, so I'm not looking forward to anything else.\"\n\nAllen went on to say he would play for only a select few teams if he were traded -- otherwise, he would retire.\n\n\"If It did come down to that, adios, amigos,\" Allen said then with a smile. \"I'll get picked up in the offseason or right before the playoffs like them old heads are doing.\"\n\nBut the general manager who drafted Allen, Tom Telesco, is gone, and new general manager Joe Hortiz and head coach Jim Harbaugh don't have the same ties to him.\n\nWith Allen's departure, Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston are the Chargers' top receivers. L.A. has the No. 5 pick in the draft, and considering the loaded receiver class, it seems likely that the Chargers will now look at that position.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C.: On March 8, U.S. District Judge Mary K. Dimke rejected a challenge to a Washington state law, one of three bills signed by Democratic Governor Jay Inslee in 2023 to address gun violence, that allows for lawsuits against the gun industry in certain circumstances.\n\nThe new law requires the industry to exercise reasonable controls in making, selling, and marketing weapons, including preventing guns from being sold to people known to be dangerous or to straw buyers.\n\nIt also allows attorneys-general or private parties, such as family members of shooting victims, to sue for violations or damages under the state's Consumer Protection Act.\n\nTrade association the National Shooting Sports Foundation challenged the law in U.S. District Court in Spokane, claiming that the measure violates the Second Amendment and the free-speech rights of its members.\n\nJudge Dimke said the organization had not established legal standing to challenge the measure and noted that its members were neither being sued under the law nor had expressed an intent to violate its terms.\n\nIn a news release, Democratic Attorney-General Bob Ferguson, who is running for governor, said, \"This law protects Washingtonians from gun violence by ensuring that gun industry members face real accountability when their irresponsible conduct harms our communities.\"\n\nCongress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005 to protect the gun industry from liability in some circumstances. However, Ferguson said states are allowed to create exemptions.\n\nWashington, Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and California are exempt from that federal law.",

        "title": "Judge rejects bid by Donald Trump to throw out classified documents case on constitutional grounds - West Hawaii Today",
        "body": "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- A federal judge on Thursday rejected one bid by Donald Trump to throw out his classified documents criminal case, and appeared skeptical during hours of arguments of a separate effort to scuttle the prosecution ahead of trial.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon issued a two-page order saying that though the Trump team had raised \"various arguments warranting serious consideration,\" a dismissal of charges was not merited. The case involves boxes of records, some highly classified, that Trump took to his Mar-a-Lago estate when he left the White House.\n\nCannon, who was appointed to the bench by the former president, had made clear during more than three-and-a-half hours of arguments that she was reluctant to dismiss one of the four criminal cases against the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee. She said at one point that a dismissal of the indictment would be \"difficult to see\" and that it would be \"quite an extraordinary\" step to strike down an Espionage Act statute that underpins the bulk of the felony counts against Trump but that his lawyers contend is unconstitutionally vague.\n\nThe ruling from Cannon is a modest win for special counsel Jack Smith's team, which in addition to the classified documents case is pursuing a separate prosecution of Trump on charges that he plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut it left unanswered questions over when the case might proceed to trial and only covered one of the two motions argued in court on Thursday. A separate motion about whether Trump was permitted under the Presidential Records Act to retain the documents after he left the White House remains pending, but the judge also seemed disinclined to throw out the case on those grounds.\n\n\"It's difficult to see how this gets you to the dismissal of an indictment,\" she told a Trump lawyer.\n\nTrump attended Thursday's arguments, listening intently with his hands sometimes clasped in front of him on the defense table as his attorneys pressed Cannon to throw out the case.\n\nThe hearing was the second this month in the case in Florida, which has unfolded slowly in the courts since prosecutors first brought charges last June. Cannon heard arguments on March 1 on when to schedule a new trial date -- it was initially set for May 20 -- but has yet to announce one and gave no indication Thursday on when she might do so. Prosecutors have pressed the judge to set a date for this summer. Trump's lawyers are hoping to put it off until after the election.\n\nAfter the hearing, Trump on his Truth Social platform took note of the \"big crowds\" outside the courthouse, which included supporters with flags and signs who honked their car horns in solidarity with the ex-president. He again said the prosecution is a \"witch hunt\" inspired by President Joe Biden.\n\nSome of Thursday's arguments centered on the 1978 statute known as the Presidential Records Act. The law requires presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration, though former presidents may retain notes and papers created for purely personal reasons.\n\nHis lawyers say the act entitled him to designate as personal property the records he took with him to Mar-a-Lago in Florida and that he was free to do with the documents as he pleased.\n\n\"He had original classification authority,\" said defense lawyer Todd Blanche. \"He had the authority to do whatever he thought was appropriate with his records.\"\n\nProsecutors countered that those records were clearly presidential, not personal, and included top-secret information and documents related to nuclear programs and the military capabilities of the U.S. and foreign countries. They say the presidential records statute was never meant to permit presidents to retain classified and top-secret documents, like those kept at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The documents charged in the indictment are not personal records, period. They are not,\" Harbach said. \"They are nowhere close to it under the definition of the Presidential Records Act.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers separately challenged as overly vague a statute that makes it a crime to have unauthorized retention of national defense information, a charge that forms the basis of 32 of the 40 felony counts against Trump in the case.\n\nDefense lawyer Emil Bove said ambiguity in the statute permits what he called \"selective\" enforcement by the Justice Department, leading to Trump being charged but enabling others to avoid prosecution. Bove suggested a recent report by special counsel Robert Hur that criticized President Joe Biden's handling of classified information did not recommend charges proved his point about the lack of clarity.\n\nWhen a law is unclear, Bove told Cannon, \"The court's obligation is to strike the statute and say 'Congress, get it right.'\"\n\nJay Bratt, another prosecutor with Smith's team, disputed that there was anything unclear about the law, and Cannon pointedly noted that striking down a statute would be \"quite an extraordinary step.\"\n\nIn her subsequent ruling rejecting the defense request, she cited \"still-fluctuating definitions of statutory terms/phrases\" along with \"disputed factual issues\" that could be decided by a jury.\n\nTrump is accused of intentionally holding onto some of the nation's most sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago -- only returning a fraction of them upon demand by the National Archives. Prosecutors say he urged his lawyer to hide records and to lie to the FBI by saying he no longer was in possession of them and enlisted staff to delete surveillance footage that would show boxes of documents being moved around the property.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are refusing to release millions of dollars in funding that Washington views as critical to help tackle spiraling violence in Haiti, in another potential stumbling block for the international force.\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on Senate Foreign Relations, have both put \"holds\" on $40 million requested by the U.S. State Department, warning the administration they need \"a lot more details\" before it gets more funding.\n\nCongressional aides said the money being held could prevent deployment of the Kenyan police force to Haiti, unless another country stepped up to fill in the gap. The $40 million would cover costs essential to the mission.\n\nThe State Department is engaging with Congress on approval for the funds, a senior State Department official said.\n\n\"We think it's critical for deployment,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nGang violence has spiraled in Haiti, fueling a humanitarian crisis, cutting off food supplies and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Prime Minister Ariel Henry pledged on Monday to resign as soon as a transition council and temporary leader were chosen.\n\nCountries have been slow to offer support and doubts have grown after Kenya - which had pledged to lead it - announced it was pausing the deployment after Henry announced he would resign.\n\nKenya's government pledged 1,000 officers to lead an international security force last July, but the initiative has been tied up in court challenges and Kenya has asked to be paid upfront.\n\nUS PLEDGE INCREASED TO $300 MILLION\n\nThe U.S. is the largest backer for the force, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced at talks on Monday in Jamaica that the U.S. was upping its pledge to $300 million.\n\n\"Given the long history of U.S. involvement in Haiti with few successful results, the administration owes Congress a lot more details in a more timely manner before it gets more funding,\" Risch and McCaul said in a joint statement.\n\nThe lawmakers said President Joe Biden's administration had only sent them a \"rough plan\" to address the crisis. They have concerns over whether Kenyan courts would allow the deployment and whether the force could get to Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe first State Department official said 68 briefings had been held with Congress on the situation in Haiti and the force, adding that $50 million in funds, including what is being held, would go toward equipment for the force, training, personnel kits and uniforms.\n\nOf that, $10 million that has been released has already been obligated, including to reimburse Kenya for training, the official said.\n\nThe Department of Defense's contribution of $200 million, which would support logistics, supplies and services to contributing countries, is already approved by Congress, a Pentagon spokesperson said.\n\nA second senior State Department official said the U.S. has also been encouraging other nations to make contributions, but the challenge is \"unprecedented global crises,\" including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nKeith Mines, vice president for Latin America at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he would be surprised if Kenya can send its police before receiving funds.\n\n\"I don't think they can go at all until the funding is there,\" Mines said.\n\n(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington and Aaron Ross in Nairobi; Editing by Don Durfee and Lincoln Feast.)",

Jennifer Crumbley was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in February.\n\nThe verdicts -- one each for the four victims -- were read around 7:15 p.m. at the end of a full day of deliberations in Oakland County court.\n\nJames Crumbley, 47, who heard the outcome through headphones because of a hearing problem, shook his head from side to side as the jury foreman said \"guilty.\"\n\nFamily of some of the fallen students wept quietly and gripped each other's hands in the second row of the courtroom.\n\nLater at a news conference, county prosecutor Karen McDonald stood next to them and praised their \"unwavering courage\" through extraordinary tragedy and grief.\n\nDefense attorney Mariell Lehman said James Crumbley \"obviously feels terrible\" about what happened at the school. He and his wife each face a possible minimum sentence of as much as 10 years in prison when they return to court April 9.\n\nProsecutors focused on two key themes at the trial: the parents' response to a morbid drawing on Ethan Crumbley's math assignment a few hours before the shooting, and the teen's access to a Sig Sauer 9 mm handgun purchased by James Crumbley only four days earlier.\n\nEthan, 15, made a ghastly drawing of a gun and a wounded man on a math assignment and added disturbing phrases, \"The thoughts won't stop. Help me. My life is useless.\"\n\nBut James and Jennifer Crumbley declined to take Ethan home following a brief meeting at the school, and staff didn't demand it. A counselor, concerned about suicidal ideations, told them to seek help for the boy within 48 hours.\n\nEthan had told counselor Shawn Hopkins that he was sad over the death of his dog and grandmother and the loss of a friend who had abruptly moved away. He said the drawing was simply his jottings for a video game and that he wasn't planning to commit violence.\n\nNeither he, nor his parents, told school officials about the gun they had just bought, according to trial testimony.\n\nHopkins had hoped Ethan would spend the day with his parents. But when that was ruled out, the counselor felt the teen would probably be safer around others at school.\n\nEthan later pulled the Sig Sauer from his backpack and began shooting that same day, killing Justin Shilling, 17; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Tate Myre, 16. No one had checked the bag, though a school administrator had joked about its heaviness.",

        "title": "The pitching paisan: Sam Aldegheri, a Phillies prospect from Italy, dreams of MLB",
        "body": "CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Sam Aldegheri fell in love with baseball by accident. As a kid in San Martino Buon Albergo -- a small town in Verona, Italy -- his only connection to Major League Baseball was forged through YouTube videos of Clayton Kershaw. One of the few baseball fields in Verona was five minutes from his house. His older brother was a pitcher. The boys' parents were too busy with work to take them to soccer, so this was it.\n\n\"I grew up at the baseball field,\" Aldehgeri said.\n\nThis is a perfectly American story that happened in the unlikeliest of places -- a medieval town that was the setting for \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Aldegheri discovered he threw better with his left hand. His brother, a righty, taught him how to pitch. Some Italian coaches offered cursory advice. He discovered MLB through internet highlight reels.\n\nAnd, when he was 15, a scout from the Kansas City Royals noticed Aldegheri at a tournament in Spain. \"You might be a prospect,\" the scout told him. Aldegheri had to convince his mother it wasn't a joke.\n\nThat's when he knew.\n\n\"I need to be a big leaguer,\" Aldegheri said. \"I need to sign for a professional team.\"\n\nThe Phillies paid him a $210,000 bonus to sign in 2019. The kid from Verona, Italy, can reach 95 mph now. He is not a top prospect, but he's intriguing to rival evaluators, some of whom have projected him as a possible back-of-the-rotation pitcher in the majors. Aldegheri, 22, has pitched only 117 innings since signing and finished last season at High A. But the Phillies put Aldegheri on their prospect team for a showcase game Saturday.\n\n\"It's an interesting profile,\" Phillies assistant general manager Preston Mattingly said of Aldegheri. \"It's what starting pitchers look like in the minor leagues.\"\n\nIt's been 74 years since an Italian-born player threw a pitch in an MLB game. Marino Pieretti, a righty who appeared in 194 games from 1945-50, moved to America before he turned 1. Alex Liddi, an infielder, played 61 games for the Seattle Mariners from 2011-13. He was the first one raised in Italy to reach the majors.\n\nAldegheri would be the first Italian-born-and-raised pitcher.\n\n\"Oh, I'm a hundred percent sure that I will make it,\" Aldegheri said. \"I don't know how and when. But I'm sure I will make it to the bigs.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n\"Because it's my life,\" he said. \"I'm working out every day. It's my dream. I am living to be a big leaguer. I've made a lot of sacrifices. I'm far from home, from my family. I left everything there. That's what I feel like I'm living for. So I'm 100 percent sure. I know I'm a good pitcher. I have good stuff.\"\n\nThe Phillies employ a scout, Claudio Scerrato, whose job is to roam all of Europe. \"It's not always that productive, but he knows the players,\" said Sal Agostinelli, the Phillies' longtime international scouting boss. Scerrato, who is based in Italy, called Agostinelli in 2019 with a tip about Aldegheri. Agostinelli was planning to attend a European tournament, but this sealed it.\n\n\"I remember like it was today,\" Agostinelli said. \"He comes out to start the game and he's 88 to 91 (mph). A left-handed, 17-year-old kid. I'm like, 'What the f -- is this?' I'm like, 'Holy s -- .' And the thing is, he did it easy.\"\n\nIt was confusing because Aldegheri looked more polished than most Italian-born pitchers. The only professional league in the country plays on weekends. It's the equivalent of Low-A ball -- maybe. Italian descendants have starred in the majors. But the sport has not evolved there.\n\n\"In Italy, I didn't even know what arm care was,\" Aldegheri said. \"I didn't even know how to do medicine ball exercises or anything like that. So everything was like, 'Wow.' Even the Trackman during bullpens. At first, when they showed me the numbers, I'm like, 'I don't know what you're showing me, man.' For me, everything here is new.\"\n\nAldegheri credited his older brother, Mattia, who has pitched five years in Italian Serie A, with developing his mechanics. \"I don't know if he saw something in me, or just because he was my brother and wanted to help,\" Aldegheri said. He urged Sam to keep trying. Sam called Mattia \"my hero.\"\n\nIt took months to negotiate the deal with the Phillies in 2019. Agostinelli, the son of Italian immigrants, feared that Aldegheri's father was shopping the Phillies' offer to other teams.\n\n\"And it wasn't that at all,\" Agostinelli said. \"He just was worried.\"\n\nSeverino, Aldegheri's father, works with glass windows. His mother works in a large bakery. \"Especially for Italians, family is really important,\" Aldegheri said. \"It's the first thing.\" It's not as if his parents did not believe in him.\n\n\"They just didn't want to accept that I was leaving home,\" Aldegheri said. \"But now they're happy.\"\n\nThis month, Aldegheri's parents are coming to America to see him pitch for the first time. One of Agostinelli's favorite wines in the entire world -- Amarone -- is from Verona.\n\nSeverino is bringing a few bottles for Agostinelli.\n\nAldegheri has a photo on his iPhone of a ticket stub from Aug. 24, 2021 -- the only big-league game he's attended. The Phillies flew him to Philadelphia so he could meet with team doctors. He sat in Section 121 at Citizens Bank Park and watched the Phillies lose to the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nThe dream wasn't as bright then. The pandemic prevented him from coming to America in 2020 and delayed his arrival in 2021. By August 2021, Aldegheri had been diagnosed with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow. He rested it, then reinjured it in 2022. He never had surgery. He weathered his first full professional season in 2023 and posted a 4.20 ERA in 83 2/3 innings with a 27 percent strikeout rate and 10 percent walk rate. He could spin the ball. His fastball sat 92.5 mph. He gained physical and mental strength.\n\nHe spent October and November at the Phillies' complex in Florida. He flew home to Italy for the holidays, then returned to America on Jan. 7. As the big-league pitchers arrived, Aldegheri found a daily spot behind the mounds to watch Aaron Nola, Zack Wheeler and Ranger Suárez. He marveled at the cameras and attention devoted to routine throwing sessions.\n\n\"Being that close to big leaguers,\" Aldegheri said, \"we can touch it.\"\n\nHe has not considered his potential place in MLB history. His teammates tease him about it; they call him the Italian Stallion. Aldegheri could reach the majors in the city that fetishizes Rocky Balboa. He's aware of the strong Italian culture in Philadelphia.\n\n\"That's why I want to play there,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, he's got a chance,\" Agostinelli said. \"He's a lefty. Put it this way: If he stays healthy, he'll pitch in the big leagues. He will.\"\n\nBut Aldegheri still has much to prove. He'll begin the season at High-A Jersey Shore and, by the end of the season, he hopes to have forced the Phillies to add him to the 40-man roster. He called himself \"a normal kid from Italy,\" but knows that as his profile grows, he could become an inspiration for another generation of Italian baseball players.\n\n\"Follow your dreams and work hard,\" Aldegheri said. \"Because it's worth it. I'm living a dream and I can say, 'Thank God, I'm here.'\"",

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) after it plunged into crisis and is in talks with other EU members who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement's human rights clause.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would discuss support for Ukraine, coordination on the war in the Middle East, and reaffirm their support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\n\nBiden, who often speaks of his Irish heritage and is fond of quoting Irish poets, visited Ireland last April to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his support for the peace deal.\n\nDuring the tour of Ireland, the longest ever by a sitting U.S. president, Biden visited his ancestral hometown, had a chance meeting with the priest who performed the last rites on his son Beau, addressed the Irish parliament and attended a state banquet at Dublin Castle.

        "title": "Rosenthal: Mookie Betts knows he's taking a chance at shortstop. He wants the challenge",
        "body": "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The danger of the Los Angeles Dodgers playing Mookie Betts at shortstop is not that his hitting will suffer. Betts excels at compartmentalizing, separating his offense from his defense. Nor is the danger a greater risk of injury. True, shortstop is more physically demanding than second base, but Betts relished playing infield last season in part because it reduced the wear and tear on his body.\n\nThe danger with the move, if there actually is one when talking about one of the game's best athletes, is that Betts' defense at short will be mediocre. Heck, it should be mediocre, considering that until last season, he hadn't played the position since 2013, when he was in A ball. His entire minor-league experience at short consisted of only 14 games.\n\nSo, why are the Dodgers doing this, even if the decision, in the classic description by manager Dave Roberts, is only \"permanent for now\"? Because the team believes strongly in Gavin Lux's bat, and wants to see if his throwing will improve moving from short to second. Because making Miguel Rojas the primary shortstop for a second straight season might be too much to ask of him at 35. And mostly, because Betts is confident he can play the position at a high level.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Betts said Wednesday, on the eve of the team leaving for Seoul, South Korea. \"There is a lot of doubt out there, which is cool. That's what makes it fun. Somebody's going to be right. We'll find out.\"\n\nBetts, 31, is well aware he is taking a chance, that the 16 games he played at short last season and all the grounders he took regularly in pregame work can't make up for all the time he has missed at the position since the Boston Red Sox decided his arm wasn't strong enough to handle it more than a decade ago.\n\nOn Monday, addressing Dodgers minor leaguers, he acknowledged, in so many words, that he could flop. But here he is, a superstar with a $365 million guarantee, the third largest in major-league history, willing to move to a more difficult spot on the defensive spectrum for the benefit of his team. Betts' selflessness and willingness to make himself vulnerable, according to multiple Dodgers people who were present, sent the minor leaguers a powerful message.\n\n\"He said, 'Look, this is kind of putting myself out there for a potential to fail. But I'm willing to do it because it gives us the best chance to win,'\" Dodgers farm director Will Rhymes said. \"He expressed to our guys that he wanted to prove he could do it. It's pretty clear when you listen to him he loves challenges. He loves taking them head on.\"\n\nRhymes said he sensed Betts has \"a little bit of a chip on his shoulder\" from the Red Sox's decision to move him off short more than a decade ago. If his arm wasn't strong enough for the position then, it certainly is now. He also is motivated, Dodgers people say, by the possibility of becoming only the second player to win a Gold Glove in both the outfield and infield. Darin Erstad won two as an outfielder in 2000 and '02 and one as a first baseman in 2004.\n\n\"I've never seen a challenge presented to Mookie Betts that he doesn't not only succeed at, but wildly succeed at,\" Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said. \"This is something that for years he's talked about, his disappointment with getting moved off shortstop. Two hundred times a year, since we've had him, we've seen him taking balls at shortstop.\n\n\"As we started to work him into second base more, there's no question in our mind that the hands play, and the range plays. And anyone who has seen him play right field knows the arm plays. Now it's just about reps, to sync up his body to get to his arm for the different throws a shortstop makes opposed to a right fielder. And if this weren't something he was all-in on and not only all-in on but excited about, we wouldn't mess with it.\"\n\nBetts did fine at second last season, or more than fine, depending upon which defensive metric you believe. He tied for sixth in defensive runs saved, a cumulative stat, despite playing only 485 innings. In Outs Above Average, he was 21st out of the 40 players who had enough innings to qualify, rating just below average overall.\n\nIn scouting terms, he might be only fringe average at short when the season begins. But would anyone put it past him to improve to average by the All-Star break and slightly above average by season's end?\n\nAs Friedman explained, \"Even an average shortstop would be a wildly valuable player,\" considering Betts' offense at the position figures to be among the best in the league.\n\n\"We don't see it as that different than playing him at second base,\" Friedman said. \"The biggest difference between second base and shortstop is how much more important arm strength is at short. If the question is, 'I can't believe you're going to play him at short,' the question should have been, 'Oh my God, you're going to play him at second,' a month ago.\"\n\nThe downside? If Betts struggles defensively, the left side of the Dodgers' infield, in theory, could be a problem. But Max Muncy, seeking to restore his play at third base to what it was in 2022, altered his offseason conditioning program and reported in better shape. The team also has other options at short. Rojas can start a few days a week, with Betts shifting to second. Kiké Hernández is another possibility. Chris Taylor plays in the infield as well.\n\nMuch depends on Lux, whom Friedman described as \"special in the batter's box.\" Lux, 26, missed the entire 2023 season after undergoing major knee surgery. His throwing problems early in Cactus League play prompted the Dodgers to play Betts at short. If Lux can hold down second, the team could get plus offense at all four infield positions, compensating for any defensive shortcomings up the middle or at third. If not, the Dodgers will just shift to another plan.\n\nThe season is long. So much can change. A trade for a shortstop hardly is out of the question for the Dodgers -- if not by Opening Day, then at the deadline. Willy Adames remains an obvious target, and the Milwaukee Brewers' chances of contending diminished with the news that closer Devin Williams will miss around three months after being diagnosed with two stress fractures in his back.\n\nBetts understands he can't make up for lost time at short. Great players, though, do not like to be embarrassed. He plans to prepare as diligently as possible, and embrace the challenge of playing a position he never wanted to leave. \"It's going to be tough. But life is tough, too,\" Betts said, smiling. \"Can't be harder than life.\"\n\nPut it that way, and the move doesn't sound so dangerous at all.",

        "title": "Lower House passes bill that could ban TikTok in U.S.",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- TikTok once again finds itself in a precarious position as lawmakers in Washington move forward with a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban on the platform.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, passed legislation that would ban TikTok if its China-based owner ByteDance doesn't sell its stakes in the popular social media platform within six months of the bill's enactment.\n\nThe legislation essentially gives ByteDance two options: sell TikTok or face a ban in U.S.\n\nIf ByteDance chooses to divest its stakes, TikTok would continue to operate in the U.S. if the President determines \"through an inter-agency process\" that the platform is \"no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\"\n\nThe bill would also require ByteDance to give up control of TikTok's well-known algorithm, which feeds users contentbased off their preferences.\n\nExperts have said it will be challenging for ByteDance to sell TikTok in a few months.\n\nIf the company chooses not to sell, TikTok would be prohibited from app stores - such as those offered by Apple and Google - as well as web-hosting services until a divesture occurs, according to the bill.\n\nWhy are American lawmakers concerned about TikTok?\n\nLawmakers from both Demcratic and Republican parties - as well as law enforcement and intelligence officials - have long expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over data on the 170 million Americans who use TikTok. The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering - which ByteDance would likely be subject to - and other far-reaching ways the country's authoritarian government exercises control.\n\nTikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government. The company has said it has never shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities and won't do so if its asked. To date, U.S. government also has not provided any evidence that shows TikTok shared such information with Chinese authorities.\n\nApart from security concerns, some lawmakers, researchers and critics of TikTok posit the app suppresses content unfavorable to Beijing, which TikTok denies. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also warned in a report released Monday that the Chinese government has used TikTok to influence recent U.S. elections.\n\n\"TikTok accounts run by a PRC (People's Republic of China) propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the U.S. midterm election cycle in 2022,\" the report said.\n\nWill TikTok shut down in U.S. now?\n\nNo. The Senate would also need to pass the measure for it to become law. But it's unclear what will happen in that chamber, where several bills aimed at banning TikTok have stalled. Senate lawmakers have indicated this bill would undergo a thorough review. President Joe Biden has said he will sign the bill if lawmakers pass it. If that happens, ByteDance would have 180 days to sell TikTok to a qualified buyer.\n\nThe proposal could also be challenged in the courts by TikTok, which has sued to counter other attempts to ban the platform both nationally and at the state level.\n\nWhat happened to the previous attempts made to ban TikTok?\n\nIn 2020, former President Donald Trump attempted to ban the social media platform through an executive order. This was later blocked by the courts after TikTok sued.\n\nThe Trump administration also brokered a deal in 2020 that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok on national security grounds. But the sale never went through for a number of reasons, one being China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.\n\nThe Biden administration revoked Trump's executive order but continued a review of the platform by the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an intra-agency committee that reportedly threatened to ban TikTok last year if its Chinese owners don't divest their stakes. The White House acknowledged last month that review remains ongoing.\n\nOther efforts from federal lawmakers to enact nationwide bans were stalled last year amid lobbying from TikTok as well as influencers and small businesses who use the platform. The American Civil Liberties Union and some digital rights groups have opposed a TikTok ban on free speech grounds and argued the latest House bill would violate the rights of Americans who rely on the app for information, advocacy and entertainment.\n\nHow are TikTok content creators in U.S. reacting to the latest bill?\n\nIf the House bill becomes law, it would be bad news for small businesses who rely on the platform for marketing or sell products on TikTok Shop -- the company's e-commerce arm. It would also impact the lives of social media influencers who have spent years cultivating their following on the platform, and rely on it to acquire brand deals or other types of income.\n\nMany TikTok influencers were flown into into Washington this week by the company to participate in a lobbying blitz against the bill. Some said a ban on the app would disrupt their lives and businesses.\n\nWhat about TikTok users?\n\nTikTok sent a notification to some users in the U.S. last week urging them to call their representatives about the measure, which it characterized as a \"TikTok shutdown.\" The company told users Congress was planning \"total ban\" on the platform that could \"damage millions of businesses, destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country and deny artists an audience.\"\n\nOn Thursday, many users responded by inundating congressional offices with calls, leading some to shut off their phones.\n\nCan I access TikTok if it gets banned?\n\nExperts say users in the U.S. can likely find ways to get around a ban. App users can try to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to disguise their location and bypass such restrictions, said Roger Entner, a telecom analyst and the founder of Recon Analytics. It will be challenging for the government to crack down on that behavior because there are many foreign VPN services that don't need to abide by U.S. laws, Entner said.\n\nBut the use of VPNs also raises additional security questions, especially for users who go with a free or cheap VPN provider they haven't carefully vetted. / AP",

        "title": "Cum arată muzeul \"imersiv și senzorial\" de la New York unde biletul de intrare e peste 250 lei",
        "body": "\"Mercer Labs: Museum of Art and Technology\", dedicat artistului Roy Nachum - pictor, sculptor, designer de coloane sonore, muzică electronică, jocuri de lumini şi laser, fotografie şi imagini video - este accesibil din ianuarie în cartierul financiar Wall Street, în sudul Manhattanului.\n\nNachum şi investitorul său, dezvoltatorul imobiliar newyorkez Michael Cayre, speră să obţină profit din acest fost centru comercial de 3.300 de metri pătraţi de îndată ce \"muzeul\" se va deschide oficial, la 28 martie, după cinci ani de studii şi lucrări care au costat 35 de milioane de dolari, au declarat pentru AFP cei doi tineri cu vârste de circa 40 de ani.\n\nChiar şi pentru un oraş atât de scump ca New York, unde cultura şi divertismentul abundă, preţul biletului este astronomic: 52 de dolari pentru un adult, 46 de dolari pentru un pensionar sau un tânăr şi aproape 200 de dolari pentru o familie formată din patru persoane. Totul, însă, pentru o oră de \"experienţă supremă\", a subliniat Cayre.\n\nMercer Labs va fi prezent pe Instagram sau TikTok, la fel ca numeroase spaţii deschise în Manhattan în ultimii ani, precum vederi panoramice de pe \"Summit One\" din turnul Vanderbilt şi din punctul de observare şi terasa în aer liber din zgârie-norii One World Trade Center şi The Edge.\n\nRoy Nachum, născut la Ierusalim în 1979 şi stabilit la New York în ultimii 20 de ani, este renumit în comunitatea designerilor pentru ilustrarea albumului \"Anti\" al vedetei Rihanna, lansat în 2015.\n\nPe coperta albumului se află un copil la bustul gol, cu ochii acoperiţi de o coroană de aur cu litere Braille. O imagine emblematică a operei lui Nachum, în omagiu adus bunicii sale cu deficienţe de vedere, ce se regăseşte peste tot la Mercer Labs, în fotografii, imagini video, picturi şi statui create de artist.\n\nInstituţia doreşte să \"redefinească experienţa muzeală în 15 spaţii expoziţionale interactive, cu întâlniri sonore unice şi instalaţii imersive, unde legăturile dintre artă şi tehnologie sunt regândite\", potrivit prezentării dată publicităţii de muzeu.\n\nÎntr-o perioadă în care marile muzee tradiţionale din SUA şi Europa caută să găsească modalităţi de atragere a tinerilor în era digitală şi a imaginii pe reţelele sociale, Mercer Labs propune \"o nouă abordare\", a declarat Nachum.\n\n\"În toate muzeele, nu poţi atinge operele. Aici, am vrut ca oamenii să le poată atinge, să interacţioneze cu ele\", a explicat artistul.\n\nVizitatorii sunt atraşi într-o cameră întunecată unde imagini video, fotografii şi holograme create de Nachum sunt proiectate pe pereţi, pe podea şi pe tavan, într-o atmosferă de club de noapte, cu muzică electronică şi nori din vapori de apă.\n\nÎntr-o altă încăpere, pentru o experienţă de imersiune sonoră \"în 4D\", vizitatorii se pot întinde pe un covor gros, pot atinge pereţii căptuşiţi şi pot aţipi sub o lumină albastră.\n\nÎn \"camera dragonului\", 500.000 de micro-lămpi LED proiectate şi controlate de calculator, desenează animale mitologice.\n\n\"Vrem să atingem toate simţurile\", a spus entuziasmat Roy Nachum, pentru care \"tehnologia reprezintă un instrument, un alt creion, un alt stilou, o altă pensulă (...) în încercarea de a crea ceva nou\".\n\nSursa foto: Mercer Labs",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Two hotels and several residents of San Francisco's troubled Tenderloin district sued the city on Thursday, alleging it is using the neighborhood as a containment zone for rampant illegal drug use and other vices, making residents terrified to leave their homes and businesses unable to recruit staff.\n\nPlaintiffs do not seek monetary damages, according to the complaint filed in federal court. Instead, they want officials to clear sidewalks of illegal drug dealers and fentanyl users, violent behavior and tent encampments and to treat the Tenderloin as it would any other neighborhood where crime is not tolerated.\n\nThey say city officials have allowed such behavior to flourish in the area -- and not spill into other neighborhoods -- by refusing to keep sidewalks clear for people using walkers or wheelchairs and failing to ban sidewalk vending, among other acts of omission.\n\n\"They demand an end to the rampant illegal street vending, and from the squalor and misery that exists throughout their neighborhood because the city has decided that people in the throes of addiction can live and die on the Tenderloin's streets,\" said Matt Davis, one of the attorneys, in a prepared statement.\n\nThe Tenderloin has long troubled city leaders, including Mayor London Breed, who declared an emergency in the district and twice vowed crackdowns on drugs. She is in a tough reelection contest in November, when she faces three serious challengers who say her administration has failed to address homelessness, encampments or the open-air drug market.\n\nBreed's office said the recently approved Proposition E, which she put on the ballot, will bring more officers and resources to the neighborhood, including surveillance cameras.\n\n\"We have made improvements in the neighborhood, but the mayor understands the frustrations of residents and businesses in the Tenderloin and will continue her efforts to make the neighborhood safer and cleaner,\" the statement read.\n\nHer office cited a court injunction from a 2022 lawsuit filed by homeless people and their advocates against the city that Breed and other officials say limits their ability to dismantle encampments.\n\nThe judge in that case ordered city officials to stop forcing homeless people from public camping sites unless they have been offered appropriate shelter indoors. The issue is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThere are five anonymous plaintiffs in Thursday's lawsuit along with entities that operate the Phoenix Hotel and the Best Western Road Coach Inn.\n\nThey include Jane Roe, a married housekeeper with two young children who doesn't make enough money to move. Drug dealers block the entrance to her building and she often sees \"users openly injecting or smoking narcotics\" and people on the ground \"who appear unconscious or dead,\" the complaint states. Her children can never be outside without a parent, she alleges.\n\nSusan Roe is elderly and uses a walker, but shopping carts and broken down bicycles block the sidewalk, forcing her to step out into the busy street, according to the complaint. She also has to navigate around \"excrement, used syringes, vomit and garbage.\"",
